//! Monitoring-only runtime telemetry (12 §6.3, B13).
//!
//! This module is explicitly outside the frozen 02 integration contract. The
//! frontend never consumes it, it carries no integration-contract version, and
//! its shape may change without a 02 §13 bump. Every collection is bounded so
//! an operations scrape remains deterministic and bounded in runtime work.
