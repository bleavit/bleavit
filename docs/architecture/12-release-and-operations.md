# 12 — Release Engineering and Operations

**Status: normative component specification. Supersedes the corresponding sections of BACKEND_PLAN.md/FRONTEND_PLAN.md** — specifically FRONTEND_PLAN §9.5–§9.8 (release-relevant parts), §22–§25, §27–§28 and BACKEND_PLAN §28 — implementing [D-6](00-decision-record.md) (layer-2 operator commitments), [D-14](00-decision-record.md) (descriptor gating, expedited release, stranded-app channel), and [D-16](00-decision-record.md) (funding lines, ArNS permabuy, signer disjointness).

**Boundary.** This document owns: the release train (build, deploy, attestation, soak, repoint, rollback), the release/ArNS key architecture and its organizational controls, the bundle-level distribution security controls (CSP, service worker, SRI at release scope), the release-process obligations around the `ReleaseChannel` stranded-app channel, and the complete operational layer (node programs, monitoring, incident response, funding, phase-gate wiring). It **references**: the frozen chain↔frontend contract ([02](02-integration-contract.md)); treasury budget-line amounts ([08](08-treasury-and-economics.md)); the upgrade path, `DescriptorLeadTime` enforcement, `ReleaseChannel` storage definition and phase gates ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)); the frontend data/verification architecture ([10](10-frontend-architecture.md)); constants ([13](13-parameters.md)); and threat rows ([14](14-threat-model.md)). Test/release gates that this document's checklists invoke are specified in [15](15-invariants-and-testing.md).

RFC 2119 language throughout.

## 1. Release train

### 1.1 Deterministic build

Pinned Node version via container digest; `npm ci` from the committed lockfile; `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` fixed; Vite configured for content-hash-only filenames and stable chunking; a post-build normalizer strips nondeterminism (plain tree, no archive metadata). Output: `dist/` + `release.json` (version, source commit, build-recipe digest, per-file SHA-256 map, Arweave manifest TXID, chain-identity block per [02](02-integration-contract.md), supported `spec_version` range, descriptor metadata hashes — **including the Asset Hub descriptor set**, §1.6 — SBOM hash, signing key IDs, keyring generation) + `sbom.cdx.json` (CycloneDX from the lockfile). Two independent CI environments MUST produce an identical tree hash; third-party rebuild instructions are published and re-tested quarterly ([15](15-invariants-and-testing.md)).

### 1.2 Two-pass Arweave deploy

Pass 1: upload `dist/` + path manifest via permaweb-deploy/Turbo SDK → manifest TXID `M`. Pass 2: patch `release.json.arweaveManifestTxId = M`, upload `release.json` as a tagged sibling TX (`App-Release: <version>`, `App-Manifest: M`), re-upload the path manifest including it. Because the manifest references `release.json`, the final manifest TXID `M′` differs from `M`; `release.json` records the asset-tree manifest and the app resolves its own base TXID at runtime from `location`; the verification CLI checks both. **[VERIFY the exact two-pass flow against live gateway behavior — prototype gate FE-P7.]** Every release additionally creates an immutable per-release undername `vX-Y-Z_futarchy`.

### 1.3 Independent verification

Anyone MUST be able to reproduce the verdict with no project infrastructure:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/futarchy-app && cd futarchy-app && git checkout <commit>
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/src futarchy/build@sha256:<digest> ./tools/release/build.sh
./tools/verify-release compare --local dist/ --arweave <manifest-txid> \
    --release-json ar://<release-json-txid> --require-attestations 2
# fetches via ≥2 gateways with hash verification, byte-compares every file,
# verifies minisign signatures against the published keyring, checks the
# on-chain revocation set (§3.1) when a node is reachable, prints VERDICT
```

`tools/verify-release` is also published standalone. It MUST fail on any signature from a key marked revoked in the on-chain `ReleaseChannel` record (§2.3) and MUST include the signer-registry disjointness check (§2.2) in its `signers audit` subcommand.

### 1.4 Standard release checklist (normative gates)

A repoint of the production name `futarchy` to a new release MUST NOT occur until **all** of:

1. **Green release gates** per [15](15-invariants-and-testing.md) (reproducible-build gate, descriptor drift gate, wallet/browser matrices, degradation-matrix suite, attestation verification from a clean container).
2. **≥ 2 independent attestations**: builders in different organizations/infrastructure reproduce the tree hash and publish minisign-signed attestation TXs on Arweave.
3. **72 h staging soak** on `staging_futarchy` against the live target network.
4. **Changelog TX** published; release notes list the immutable TXID, attestation TXIDs, and the multi-gateway URL set.
5. **3-of-5 ArNS repoint** (§4.2) executed by the controller quorum via one ANT `setRecord`.
6. **`ReleaseChannel` update** submitted per §3 within 600 blocks of the repoint.

CI can neither sign nor repoint: CI holds **no** minisign keys and **no** ANT controller shares (verification-protocol check 8 carried forward — CI compromise can block releases but cannot ship one alone).

### 1.5 Expedited descriptor-only release (D-14)

A second, faster lane exists. It is **admissible only** for releases whose delta against the incumbent production release is confined to: `packages/descriptors/**` (including the Asset Hub descriptor set), descriptor metadata hashes and the supported `spec_version` range in `release.json`, and release metadata files (changelog, release history data). **Zero app-code delta**: every other file in the built tree MUST be byte-identical to the incumbent release.

Requirements: the same reproducible build and **2 attestations** — where each attestor additionally attests to the **delta scope** (mechanically checked by `verify-release diff-scope --against <incumbent-txid>`, which byte-compares the trees and fails if any out-of-scope file differs) — then a **3-of-5 repoint**. **No staging soak is required.** The `ReleaseChannel` update sets the `EXPEDITED` flag; every expedited release MUST be followed by a retrospective entry in the release log stating why the lane was used.

Rationale (honest scope): the soak exists to catch app-behavior regressions; a descriptor-only delta has no app-code surface to regress, while descriptor lateness is itself a live risk (§1.6). Any change touching app code — however small — MUST use the standard lane.

### 1.6 Descriptor lead-time gating (D-14, D-12)

This is a **release-gating rule, not a convention**:

- v(N+1) descriptors MUST be generated from the **queue-time artifact commitment** (the wasm/metadata hashes committed when the CODE/META proposal is queued — [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)), not from the post-enactment chain. The timelock is the build window.
- A release covering `spec_version` N+1 MUST be live on the production name **before application maturity** — `applicable_at = authorized_at + DescriptorLeadTime` (43,200 blocks = 72 h *(normative value: [13](13-parameters.md))*), where `authorized_at` is recorded when `execute()` dispatches `authorize_upgrade` and the SafetyFilter denies `apply_authorized_upgrade` until `applicable_at` ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §2.2). Because the backend enforces the lead time on-chain and the descriptors are buildable from queue time, the frontend has ≥ the full timelock plus 72 h; the standard lane (with soak) is the expected path, and the expedited lane is the repair path when the margin has been consumed (late descriptor bug, re-generation after an artifact-commitment correction).
- CI enforcement: the descriptor pipeline regenerates descriptors from each supported runtime artifact and diffs against committed ones on every PR and on every runtime release ([15](15-invariants-and-testing.md)). Monitoring (§6.3) alerts when an `UpgradeAuthorized` event exists and no covering release is live at 50% of the lead time.
- **Asset Hub set (D-12)**: the funding flow's second light-client connection pins an Asset Hub descriptor set. Asset Hub upgrades ride the Fellowship's schedule, outside this protocol's governance; the pipeline therefore monitors Asset Hub `spec_version` on both networks and ships Asset Hub descriptor refreshes through the **expedited lane** (they satisfy its admissibility by construction). A stale Asset Hub set degrades only the funding flow (labeled, per [11](11-frontend-workflows.md)), never core trading.

### 1.7 Rollback

Every release is a permanent Arweave transaction; per-release undernames plus in-app release history keep every prior version reachable by immutable TXID. Rollback = `./tools/release/repoint.sh futarchy <previous-manifest-txid>` collecting 3-of-5 signatures; nothing is deleted, so rollback is **O(minutes) and reversible**. Carried forward and still correct: for a vulnerability *introduced by the current release*, rollback ends exposure in minutes. For a vulnerability present in all prior releases, or when rollback is compat-blocked (the previous release does not cover the current `spec_version`), the fix rides the standard or expedited lane as its delta scope dictates; the `ReleaseChannel` `SECURITY` flag (§3) warns users on the affected releases in the interim.

---

## 2. Keys and signing

### 2.1 Key architecture (carried forward)

Two disjoint key populations:

- **Release minisign keys**: sign `release.json`'s hash. Keyring published in-repo, in-app, and on Arweave. Attestor keys are minisign keys of the independent builders.
- **ArNS controller keys**: control the ANT that resolves `futarchy` (§4.2).

Both: hardware-backed, geographically distributed, documented ceremony, annual rotation with overlap; old keyrings are retained in-app for verifying historical releases, tagged by **keyring generation** (a monotonically increasing `u32` carried in `release.json` and in `ReleaseChannel`). CI holds neither population (§1.4).

### 2.2 Signer disjointness (D-16) — hard organizational control

**Requirement:** the set of ArNS controller key holders and the set of minisign release-key holders MUST be disjoint: `ArNS controllers ∩ release signers = ∅`, evaluated over *natural persons*, not key IDs. Additionally, out-of-band attestation-monitor operators (§5.2) MUST NOT be ArNS controllers. Rationale: without disjointness, ~3 insiders holding 2 ArNS shares + 2 release keys ship a fully self-verifying malicious release; with it, a malicious release requires colluding across two organizationally separated groups.

**Verification procedure (normative):**

1. A **signer registry** (`SIGNERS.md` in-repo + mirrored on Arweave) lists every active minisign key ID, every ANT controller address, and every attestor key, each mapped to a stable operator identifier (a named person or a named organization role held by a named person).
2. CI mechanically checks that no operator identifier appears in both populations; a violation is release-blocking.
3. At every key ceremony (issuance, rotation, revocation) the disjointness predicate over the updated registry MUST be re-attested by ≥ 2 attestors in a signed attestation TX, and reviewed quarterly thereafter.
4. `verify-release signers audit` recomputes checks 2–3 from public data.

**Residual (declared):** the mechanical check operates on *declared* identities; a false declaration (one person under two identities) defeats it. This is an organizational-honesty limit, recorded as a threat row in [14](14-threat-model.md) alongside the founding-multisig insider row; the mitigations are the ceremony's multi-party witness requirement and the attestor sign-off.

### 2.3 Compromised-release-key revocation

Old bundles ship their keyring immutably, so revocation MUST NOT depend on shipping new code to the affected users. The path:

1. The compromised key ID is added to the **on-chain revocation set** in `ReleaseChannel` (§3.1: `keyring_generation` is bumped and the key's index is set in `revoked_key_bits`), and the `SECURITY` flag is set if any live release was signed by the revoked key.
2. All apps — including pinned and stranded ones, which read `ReleaseChannel` without current metadata — MUST treat a revoked key as invalid for every verification (self-check, update verification, attestation counting) from the moment the revocation is observed at a finalized head.
3. A new keyring generation is published via the next release and the signer registry (§2.2); `verify-release` fetches the revocation set when a node is reachable and warns loudly when it cannot.
4. If the revoked key co-signed the *current production* release, the release is re-signed by remaining valid keys (delta scope: release metadata only → expedited lane) or rolled back (§1.7).

Write authority, retro-ratification, and abuse bounds for `ReleaseChannel` are defined in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) (layout: [02](02-integration-contract.md) §12); the griefing surface (a malicious writer can at most force warnings/signing-friction in old releases, recoverable by opening a newer release) is a [14](14-threat-model.md) row.

---

## 3. Stranded-app release channel (D-14)

### 3.1 The `ReleaseChannel` raw storage key

The §24.5 `system.remark` release pointer of FRONTEND_PLAN is **deleted**: a stranded app in `ReadOnlyIncompatible` lacks current-runtime metadata exactly when it needs the pointer, and remark decoding requires it. Its replacement is a **fixed-layout raw storage value** `ReleaseChannel` in `pallet-constitution` — byte layout owned and frozen by [02](02-integration-contract.md) §12; write authority and upgrade-path wiring in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md); quoted here for readability *(normative layout: [02](02-integration-contract.md) §12)*:

fixed-width, **frozen forever** (any future need is met by appending fields beyond offset 168 with a schema bump, never by changing existing offsets), read at the well-known raw key `twox128("Constitution") ++ twox128("ReleaseChannel")` — 168 bytes:

`schema u8` · `version [u8;32]` (UTF-8 semver, zero-padded) · `manifest_txid [u8;43]` (base64url TXID) · `release_json_hash [u8;32]` · `updated_at u32` · `spec_version u32` · `pending_authorized_at u32` · `min_supported_version [u8;32]` (UTF-8 semver) · `keyring_generation u32` · `revoked_key_bits u64` (bitmask over key indices within the generation's published keyring) · `flags u32` (bit 0 `SECURITY`, bit 1 `EXPEDITED`, bit 2 `URGENT_UPGRADE`, others reserved zero).

Because the key and layout are metadata-independent, **any** shipped release — past, pinned, stranded — can read and decode it via a plain light-client storage read forever.

### 3.2 Old-app obligations (in-app upgrade warning UX — required)

Every release MUST poll `ReleaseChannel` at each finalized head (one raw read) and:

- `version >` own and `manifest_txid ≠` own → non-blocking "newer canonical release exists" banner with the immutable-TXID link (carries forward §18.6/E14 UX); pinned users MAY dismiss persistently.
- `min_supported_version >` own version → **prominent blocking warning**; signing is gated behind an explicit per-session acknowledgment; the warning names the newer release's undername and TXID.
- `SECURITY` flag set while own release's signing keys intersect `revoked_key_bits`, or own version `< min_supported_version` with `SECURITY` set → red security banner, **signing disabled** (reads continue), direct link to the newer release. This is the review's missing "warn pinned users" path: pinning protects against hostile *repoints*, and the chain channel — verified state, not a mutable name — is what reaches pinned users anyway.

The channel is advisory *display and gating* data with a bounded write authority ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)); it is never a code-delivery mechanism and never triggers automatic updates (the release-scoped service worker's no-auto-`skipWaiting` rule, §5.2, is unchanged).

---

## 4. ArNS and distribution control (F-5, X-13, D-16)

### 4.1 Tenure: permabuy

The canonical name `futarchy` MUST be held under ArNS **permabuy** (permanent registration), funded from the `ops.arweave` line (§6.1). This **closes the lease-lapse takeover**: under the previously undecided lease tenure, an expired lease let *anyone* re-register the canonical name — a full T-2-class distribution compromise requiring no key compromise at all (DESIGN_REVIEW X-13/F-mediums). With permabuy there is no renewal event to miss and no expiry failure mode; the threat row in [14](14-threat-model.md) records the closure. Staging/dev/per-release undernames ride the same permanently held name. (The deferred Bulletin mirror, if ever activated, has retention/renewal semantics and keeps its own expiry-alert runbook — FRONTEND_PLAN §31 D-Bulletin, unchanged.)

### 4.2 ANT control quorum

- **Primary:** 3-of-5 native ANT n-of-m control **if** n-of-m controller capability is confirmed by the prototype gate **[VERIFY ANT n-of-m controller capability in @ar.io/sdk 4.x — prototype gate FE-P7 ([10](10-frontend-architecture.md) §12; D-16, which notes an earlier draft mislabeled it FE-P8)]**.
- **Fallback:** if native n-of-m does not materialize, a **FROST-ed25519 threshold ceremony** producing a single on-chain controller key whose signatures require a 3-of-5 threshold of share-holders **[VERIFY FROST output compatibility with the ANT controller signature scheme — same prototype gate]**.
- **Prohibited:** single-key custody of the production ANT, under any circumstance, including "temporarily" during bootstrap. **If neither the native quorum nor the FROST ceremony materializes, launch blocks on this line** — the production name does not go live (phase-gate wiring §6.5).

Controller shares: hardware-backed, geographically distributed, holders disjoint from release signers (§2.2). Per-release immutable undernames and the boot-time ArNS resolution cross-check are carried forward ([10](10-frontend-architecture.md)); the residual — a hostile-but-*consistent* repoint by a controller quorum is policy-bound, not protocol-bound — remains disclosed in [14](14-threat-model.md), now mitigated by the out-of-band attestation monitor (§5.2) whose operators are controller-disjoint.

---

## 5. Bundle-level security controls

### 5.1 CSP: `connect-src` allowlist (F-medium)

The FRONTEND_PLAN §9.8 policy is amended in exactly one directive: **`connect-src *` is replaced by an enumerated allowlist**, rebuilt per release, containing precisely:

1. the committed WSS bootnode endpoints (the §6.2 program set, plus relay bootnodes from the bundled specs);
2. the baked static ar.io gateway fallback list (independent operators; Wayfinder's runtime gateway selection is restricted to the intersection of its network-sourced set with this allowlist);
3. the hosts of release-registry providers that ship *in this release's* vetted provider registry (empty at launch — opt-in posture unchanged), plus opted-in RPC fallback endpoints that are release-listed.

All other directives are unchanged (`default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; …`), still delivered as meta-CSP (gateways own real headers; documented limitation: meta-CSP cannot set `frame-ancestors`).

**What it does (honestly):** bounds network egress to an enumerated operator set — an XSS or compromised dependency can no longer exfiltrate to an arbitrary attacker host; exfiltration now requires an allowlisted operator's cooperation or a public channel. **What it does not do:** it is not the injection defense (that is `script-src`, unchanged); it does not stop exfiltration *to* allowlisted gateways via query strings, to chain peers via extrinsic content, or via timing channels; and a malicious gateway serving tampered HTML can strip the meta tag entirely — but that is already the T-1 altered-bundle case, caught by the T-1 controls, not by CSP. **Cost (accepted):** user-supplied custom bootnodes/RPC/provider endpoints outside the allowlist cannot be reached by the shipped bundle, because meta-CSP is fixed at build time. Expert escape hatches: request allowlisting in a release, or run a self-served build (documented in the expert panel). This trades a rarely used expert affordance for exfiltration containment for every user; user-supplied *allowlisted* endpoints still work.

### 5.2 Service worker: rules, declared residual, out-of-band attestation monitor (F-medium)

Carried forward unchanged: release-scoped SW; cache name = manifest TXID; assets fetched only by exact hashed filename from its own release; no automatic `skipWaiting` — activation only on explicit user action; old cache deleted on activation; hash-mismatch responses refused; "pin this release" toggle; SW file itself hash-listed in `release.json`.

**Removed claim:** FRONTEND_PLAN T-13's detection story — the §18.6-style in-app self-check and app-vs-ArNS version comparison — is **withdrawn as a hostile-SW control**. A malicious service worker interposes on *all* same-origin fetches, including the self-check's fetch of `release.json`, the attestation fetches, and the ArNS resolution probes: it answers them with consistent lies. In-app self-checks remain useful against *accidental* corruption and against threats that do not control the SW (T-1/T-3), but against a hostile SW they verify nothing.

**Declared residual:** one accepted malicious release achieves durable per-origin persistence — the hostile SW can keep serving itself and suppress in-app update/warning UI on that origin until the user unregisters it (browser UI), clears site data, or loads via a different origin/immutable-TXID path. This is recorded as a residual-risk row in [14](14-threat-model.md).

**Compensating control — out-of-band attestation monitor (required):** ≥ 2 independent monitor operators, **disjoint from ArNS controllers** (§2.2), run a headless fetcher (no service worker, no browser cache) that, on every finalized `ReleaseChannel` change and at least hourly:

1. resolves `futarchy` via ≥ 3 independent gateways and fetches the full served bundle by resolved TXID and by name;
2. byte-compares every file against the per-file SHA-256 map of the *signed* `release.json`, verifies the minisign signatures and ≥ 2 attestations against the current keyring generation, and cross-checks `manifest_txid` against `ReleaseChannel`;
3. on any mismatch, fires the **release-integrity alerting channel**: the monitoring stack's paging route (§6.3, `RB-RELEASE`), the public static status page, community channels, and — on confirmed compromise — the incident path of §6.4 (repoint/rollback + `ReleaseChannel` `SECURITY` flag, which reaches even users whose SW suppresses in-app banners only if they load a clean context; the status page and wallet-community channels are the honest remainder).

The monitor detects hostile *distribution* (wrong bytes served for the canonical name) from outside any SW's reach; it cannot reach into a browser profile already running a hostile SW — that residual stands as declared.

### 5.3 SRI

Unchanged from FRONTEND_PLAN §9.8: build-generated SHA-384 `integrity` attributes on every `<script>`/`<link>`; protects sub-asset integrity when honest HTML is served with tampered assets; complements, never replaces, content addressing.

---

## 6. Operational layer (X-13, X-4, D-6, D-16)

There is no application backend; "operations" is the set of **owned and funded** commitments below. Every row names an owner role (an accountable person holds each role; assignments are published in the ops handbook) and a treasury budget line whose amount is normative in [08](08-treasury-and-economics.md).

### 6.1 Owned-and-funded ops table (normative)

| Service | Commitment (MUST) | Owner role | Funding line ([08](08-treasury-and-economics.md)) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WSS bootnodes** | ≥ 8 browser-reachable WSS bootnodes across ≥ 4 operators, ≥ 2 on port 443 *(normative values: [13](13-parameters.md))*; listed in the chain spec per the [02](02-integration-contract.md) node-roles row; liveness-monitored; set updates ride releases + on-chain discovery | Bootnode program coordinator | `ops.bootnodes` |
| **Served-state window** | The protocol-funded bootnode/RPC operators jointly serve **30 days** of state and bodies *(normative value: [13](13-parameters.md))* — the [D-6](00-decision-record.md) layer-2 commitment backing FE backfill (`provider`-labeled unless smoldot re-read, per [10](10-frontend-architecture.md)) | Infrastructure coordinator | `ops.rpc_archive` |
| **Collators** | 5 invulnerables → 8–12 bonded permissionless (Phase 4+); geographic/organizational diversity feeds the Security pillar; compensation 2,000 USDC/collator/epoch *(normative value: [08](08-treasury-and-economics.md))* | Collator program coordinator | `ops.collators` |
| **RPC / archive nodes** | ≥ 4 load-balanced public RPC (rate-limited, no signing) + ≥ 2 archive nodes (oracle recomputation, dispute evidence, and the 30-day window's tail) | Infrastructure coordinator | `ops.rpc_archive` |
| **Monitoring & alerting** | The full §6.3 stack, including the release-integrity monitor (§5.2) and browser-reachability probes | Monitoring coordinator | `ops.monitoring` |
| **Keeper operations** | ≥ 2 independent operator-run keepers + the permissionless public; subsidies beyond the metered budget of 12,000 USDC/epoch *(normative value: [08](08-treasury-and-economics.md))*, with the exhaustion alarm wired to §6.3 | Keeper coordinator | `ops.keepers` |
| **Oracle evidence hosting** | Evidence artifacts and archived MetricSpec documents persisted to Arweave and mirrored on the archive nodes; retrievable for the full dispute-latency horizon ([07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md)) | Oracle operations coordinator | `ops.oracle_evidence` |
| **Watchtowers** | ≥ 2 bonded registered watchtowers for the challenge-window acknowledgment quorum ([07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md)) | Oracle operations coordinator | `ops.watchtowers` |
| **Arweave / ArNS** | Permabuy of `futarchy` (§4.1); per-release upload credits (Turbo); undername operations; status page hosting | Release operations lead | `ops.arweave` |
| **Release operations** | §1 ceremonies, key ceremonies (§2), signer registry upkeep, incident playbooks (§6.4) | Release operations lead | `ops.arweave` / `ops.monitoring` |

Bootnode operator diversity counts *organizations*, not machines; an operator MAY serve multiple roles (bootnode + RPC + archive) but the ≥ 4-operator floor applies to distinct organizations. Browser-reachability (valid TLS, WSS, port policy) is part of the commitment, not best-effort — corporate/mobile networks blocking non-443 WSS is the documented reason for the :443 floor.

### 6.2 Bootnode program

The program (FE §28(1), now backed by the [02](02-integration-contract.md) chain-spec requirement resolving X-4's ops side): operators run relay-connected futarchy nodes exposing WSS multiaddrs with valid certificates; the committed set ships in the bundled chain spec (hash-pinned) and updates ride releases plus on-chain discovery; operators self-monitor (their Prometheus) **and** the §6.3 stack probes dialability *from a browser context* (headless browser dial test per endpoint) — a bootnode that only native peers can dial fails its commitment. Served-state window: the 30-day retention is a commitment of this program's node fleet, phase-gated below; it is an *honest ops line*, not a protocol guarantee — the FE labels data accordingly ([10](10-frontend-architecture.md)).

### 6.3 Monitoring and alerting

**Runtime telemetry source (added 2026-07-18, B13).** The audited sources for the runtime-side series above that no frozen [02](02-integration-contract.md) view exposes (book P&L and its b·ln2 bound, live mid-window TWAP coverage, effective POL vs floor, collateral drift, migration-cursor stall, numerics anomaly counters, and the storage-bound remainder invisible to portable metadata) are the methods of the runtime's **`TelemetryApi`** — a monitoring-only `decl_runtime_apis!` trait that is **explicitly outside the 02 integration contract**: the frontend never consumes it, it carries no contract version, and its shape may change additively or otherwise without a 02 §13 bump or joint sign-off (this document owns it). The §6.3 exporter consumes it via `state_call` under the same per-family fail-closed degradation as every other family (failures degrade to absent series, never healthy zeros) — with one boundary drawn deliberately (amended 2026-07-18, B13 review): fail-closed covers *collection* failures only; a **computed alert condition** (e.g. a book loss exceeding its b·ln2 bound — an I-12 breach) MUST be carried in the series so its alert fires, never suppressed as a family degradation. One sourcing exception: the LMSR **domain-rejection** component of the Numerics row cannot be a runtime API or storage counter — a rejected extrinsic rolls back all storage — so its audited source is the finalized `System.ExtrinsicFailed` event stream (error identity resolved from metadata, never hardcoded), exported as a cumulative counter; the rounding-dust component rides `TelemetryApi`. Solvency-relevant methods (collateral drift) MUST be computed from the same quantities the owning pallet's try-state checks compare — the API is a window onto audited state, never a second bookkeeping.

The frontend itself still has **no telemetry of any kind**; its only diagnostic channel is user-initiated copy-to-clipboard reports (unchanged). Everything above monitors *infrastructure*, not users.

### 6.4 Incident response

Carried forward, amended: **Hostile release** — 3-of-5 repoint to the last good TXID (O(minutes)); `ReleaseChannel` update (`SECURITY` flag + `min_supported_version` bump, reaching pinned/stranded users per §3.2); key revocation if a signing key is implicated (§2.3); announcement via status page + community channels; postmortem TX. **Wrong-chain-spec** — patch release (bundle pins make cross-environment confusion non-weaponizable). **ArNS-key loss** — with permabuy the name cannot lapse; loss of quorum shares below threshold triggers the FROST/ceremony re-issuance runbook while per-release undernames and immutable TXIDs keep every release reachable; a permanently lost quorum (< 3 recoverable shares) is the declared worst case: a new name is established and announced through `ReleaseChannel` — the chain channel, not the compromised/lost name, is the recovery root. **Distribution mismatch** (monitor alert, §5.2) — treat as hostile release until proven otherwise.

### 6.5 Phase-gate wiring ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md))

The following are **entry-blocking** additions to the phase gates; amounts and phase definitions are normative in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)/[08](08-treasury-and-economics.md):

- **Phase 2 (public testnet):** bootnode program live on Paseo at full D-6 numbers; monitoring stack incl. browser-dial probes; staging/dev ArNS names; release train exercised end-to-end (incl. one expedited dry run and one rollback drill).
- **Phase 3 (mainnet shadow, production name launches):** permabuy completed; ANT quorum ceremony completed — **launch blocks here if neither native n-of-m nor FROST materializes (§4.2)**; signer-registry disjointness attested (§2.2); out-of-band attestation monitor live with ≥ 2 disjoint operators; mainnet bootnode set + 30-day served-state window operational; `ReleaseChannel` written and read back by a shipped release.
- **Phase 4 (binding decisions):** keeper funding line active with exhaustion alarm; watchtower quorum registered and funded; oracle evidence hosting live; descriptor lead-time monitoring proven against ≥ 1 full CODE/META upgrade e2e (the Phase-2 upgrade rehearsal counts only if the release-gating check fired correctly).

Advancement discipline is unchanged: published evidence + META decision + values ratification; delays always allowed, acceleration never.

## Resolves

| Finding | Resolution in this document |
|---|---|
| F-5 | §4: ArNS permabuy eliminates lease-lapse takeover; ANT control is 3-of-5 native n-of-m or FROST-ed25519 fallback; single-key custody prohibited; launch blocks on this line; the capability [VERIFY] is retained with its prototype gate (§4.2). |
| X-13 | §6.1–§6.3: every operational service has a named owner role and a treasury budget-line reference to [08](08-treasury-and-economics.md); ArNS tenure decided (permabuy); costs funded; phase-gated in §6.5. |
| X-4 (ops side) | §6.1–§6.2, §6.5: the WSS bootnode program (≥8/≥4 operators/≥2 on :443) is an owned, funded, monitored commitment wired into the chain spec ([02](02-integration-contract.md)) and the phase gates, with browser-context dial probes; the D-6 30-day served-state window rides the same fleet. |
| F-med: expedited release | §1.5–§1.7, §3: expedited descriptor-only lane (2 attestations, no soak, 3-of-5 repoint, mechanically verified zero app-code delta); descriptor release-gating before execute maturity; rollback semantics restated honestly; pinned-user warning (§3.2) and shipped-keyring revocation (§2.3) close the review's two named gaps. |
| F-med: CSP | §5.1: `connect-src *` replaced by a per-release host allowlist (bootnodes + baked gateways + release-listed opted-in providers), with an honest statement of what it contains (exfiltration bounding) and does not (injection is script-src's job; allowlisted-operator and public-channel exfiltration remain), and the accepted expert-endpoint cost. |
| F-med: hostile SW | §5.2: the §18.6-style self-check detection claim is removed (a hostile SW intercepts the checking fetches); durable per-origin persistence is a declared residual ([14](14-threat-model.md)); compensating control is the required out-of-band attestation monitor with controller-disjoint operators and a named alerting channel. |
| F-med: ArNS lease | §4.1: moot by permabuy; the old lapse threat and its closure are recorded here and in [14](14-threat-model.md). |
| F-med: system.remark (FE side) | §3: the remark pointer is deleted; stranded/pinned apps read the fixed-layout `ReleaseChannel` raw storage key ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)) without current metadata; in-app warning/blocking/security UX obligations specified per release forever. |
| F-med: signer disjointness | §2.2 (+§5.2 monitor disjointness): ArNS controllers ∩ minisign release keys = ∅ as a hard organizational control with a mechanical registry check, ceremony re-attestation, quarterly audit, a `verify-release` subcommand, and a declared residual with its threat row in [14](14-threat-model.md). |
