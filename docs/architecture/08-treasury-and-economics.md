# 08 — Treasury and Economics

**Status: normative component specification. Supersedes the corresponding sections of BACKEND_PLAN.md/FRONTEND_PLAN.md** (BE §17, §21 economics rows, §27.1–27.4 economics, ADR-14 sizing rule; FE §17.4 fee mechanics).

**Boundary.** This document owns: `pallet-futarchy-treasury` (accounts, NAV, outflow controls, streams, budget lines), genesis economics (VIT supply/allocation/vesting/issuance, initial USDC funding), the minimum-viable-NAV phase gates, the economic-security sizing regime (AttackCost̂ estimator, decide-time cap, Ask-scaled liquidity), transaction-fee economics (`fee.vit_usdc_rate`), keeper economics, intake/bond economics, and the POL seeding flow's economics. It references: ledger mechanics ([03](03-conditional-ledger.md)), book mechanics and `headroom` ([04](04-markets-and-pricing.md)), the decision engine that hosts the `SecuritySizing` step ([05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)), intake/bond lifecycle ([06](06-governance-and-guardians.md)), the reserve-health trigger ([07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md)), rollout phase gates ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)), and operations funding execution ([12](12-release-and-operations.md)). All parameter values quoted here are normative in [13](13-parameters.md); the arithmetic below is normative in *this* document.

Normative language: RFC 2119. USDC amounts in whole units (6 decimals); `ln 2 = 0.693147…`; all worked arithmetic is shown and MUST be reproduced by the Phase-0 reference model.

## 1. `pallet-futarchy-treasury` (carried forward, amended)

### 1.1 Accounts and budget lines

Derived sub-accounts: `MAIN`, `POL`, `INSURANCE`, `KEEPER`, `ORACLE`, `REWARDS`, and (new, D-16) `OPS` — whose budget lines are the lowercase `ops.*` keys used throughout this set (naming normalized with [12](12-release-and-operations.md) §6.1; values consolidated in [13](13-parameters.md)). Outflow calls accept only the `FutarchyTreasury` origin (from the execution guard) and MUST name a budget line; per-line budgets are constitution-keyed.

| Line (account) | Purpose | Per-epoch default *(normative value: [13](13-parameters.md))* |
|---|---|---|
| `POL` | Market subsidy commitments (§8) | ≤ `pol.budget_epoch` = 0.75% NAV (kernel ceiling 1.5%) |
| `POL_BASELINE` | Standing Baseline book subsidy (§4.3) | `pol.b_baseline`·ln 2 ≈ 17,329 USDC/epoch, outside `pol.budget_epoch` |
| `KEEPER` | Metered crank rebates (§6) | `keeper.budget_epoch` = 12,000 USDC |
| `ORACLE` | Reporter fees + escalation float | per-epoch line |
| `REWARDS` | Proposer rewards: PARAM 500; TREASURY/CODE min(0.05%·Ask, 25k); META 25k USDC — paid on `Executed` | — |
| `ops.bootnodes` / `ops.rpc_archive` | ≥8 WSS bootnodes; ≥4 public RPC + ≥2 archive nodes **and the 30-day served-state operator commitment** (D-6, D-16) | funded lines, named operators ([12](12-release-and-operations.md)) |
| `ops.keepers` | Keeper operations **beyond** the metered budget (D-16; §6.3) | funded line |
| `ops.oracle_evidence` | Oracle evidence hosting ([07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md)) | funded line |
| `ops.watchtowers` | ≥ 2 bonded registered watchtowers for the challenge-window quorum ([07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md), [12](12-release-and-operations.md) §6.1) | funded line |
| `ops.monitoring` | §28-equivalent monitoring | funded line |
| `ops.arweave` | Arweave/ArNS permabuy + release hosting (D-16) | funded line |
| `ops.collators` | Collator compensation, `collator.comp_epoch` = 2,000 USDC/collator/epoch (§2.4) | 5 collators ⇒ 10,000 USDC/epoch at launch |
| `ops.coretime` | Coretime renewal budget; the enumerated renewal call is **exempt from the dead-man freeze** (D-9, mechanics in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)); USDC-denominated — a renewal debits the full DOT outflow's USDC value at `ops.coretime_dot_rate`, rounded up ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §4) | funded line |
| `INSURANCE` | Slash proceeds, swept dust, fee share | inflow-only except by TREASURY decision |

Fee routing (unchanged): 30 bps market fee → 50% `INSURANCE` / 50% POL offset.

### 1.2 NAV (with haircuts and the reserve-health flag)

```
NAV = liquid USDC at par
    + undisbursed stream remainders owed *to* the treasury (cancellation reversions)
    − outstanding obligations (open stream remainders owed *from* the treasury,
      queued in-cap proposal outflows, POL commitments of live books §8.2)
VIT holdings: marked 0. In-flight XCM: marked 0 until arrival (conservative).
```

**Reserve-health haircut (new; B-med “USDC freeze”).** [07](07-oracle-and-disputes.md) defines the deterministic reserve-health sub-metric `R` in `C_onchain`. While the `R` flag is set:

1. the published NAV view carries `reserve_impaired = true` (never silently full-backing);
2. **spendable NAV for all new commitments is 0**: no new POL seeding, no new outflows, no new stream openings, and every minimum-viable-NAV gate of §4 evaluates as failing (fail-static). Existing books and existing stream claims are unaffected. One explicit carve-out (D-9, [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §4): `execute_coretime_renewal`'s `ops.coretime` line debit remains dispatchable under the flag — renewal is maintenance during exactly the degradations the flag accompanies, and NAV carries no DOT term;
3. playbook `PB-RESERVE` becomes admissible: halts `split` inflows ([03](03-conditional-ledger.md));
4. event `NavHaircutFlagged { epoch, flag }` is emitted on every flag transition. The FE MUST surface the flag on every NAV render ([10](10-frontend-architecture.md), [11](11-frontend-workflows.md)).

`nav()` is the committed [02 §4](02-integration-contract.md) `NavView`: `total` is the NAV above; `spendable_nav` is zero under the reserve-health flag; `meter_utilization_bps` is the rolling-meter utilization; `haircut_flag` is exactly `reserve_impaired`; and `class_floors` carries the §4.1 arming floors in Param/Treasury/Code/Meta order. The remaining fields decompose the treasury accounts, stream remainders and obligations. FE-15 renders the complete view ([11](11-frontend-workflows.md)).

### 1.3 Outflow controls, streams, meters (carried forward)

- Per-proposal outflow ≤ `trs.cap_proposal` = 5% NAV (kernel ceiling 10%); rolling ≤ 10% NAV/30 d and ≤ 30% NAV/180 d (monotone meters, I-7).
- Streams mandatory for grants > `trs.stream_threshold` = 1% NAV; linear, recipient-claimable, cancellable by a later TREASURY decision; cancellation reverts the undisbursed remainder to `MAIN`.
- Meter contention: execution waits queued and retries within grace.
- `recover_foreign` (assets sent to pallet accounts outside protocol flows): TREASURY-class only, never admin.

### 1.4 Calls (delta over BE §5.2.7)

`spend(line, dest, amount)`, `open_stream(line, recipient, total, start, duration)`, `cancel_stream(id)`, `claim_stream(id)` (Signed recipient), `fund_budget_line(line, amount)`, `recover_foreign(asset, dest, amount)` — all as before, line-scoped. **Custody sync (added 2026-07-17, SQ-123):** for lines backed by a dedicated real-USDC custody pot (`KEEPER` and `ORACLE`, the §6.3 rebate pots derived as `bl/trsry` sub-accounts), `fund_budget_line` is custody-synced — the call atomically transfers `amount` USDC from the `MAIN` custody account to the line's pot and fails as a whole (internal credit rolled back) if `MAIN` holds insufficient real USDC, so funding can never make the internal line ledger claim more than its pot holds; the §6.3 try-state drift alarm (line ≤ pot, per payout line) remains as the backstop against every other drift source. Lines without pots keep custody in `MAIN` (their outflow custody wiring is the A9 fungibles follow-up) (every outflow call names a budget line per §1.1; `open_stream` funds the stream from `line` and reverts its remainder there on cancellation; `recover_foreign`'s `amount` allows partial sweeps). New: `issue_vit(amount, line)` (§2.3, `FutarchyTreasury` origin, issuance-metered); vesting-schedule storage (§2.2). The `execute_coretime_renewal(period_index)` call (permissionless Signed keeper, dead-man-freeze exempt per D-9) is specified in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §4; its companions (added 2026-07-18, SQ-245/SQ-246 ruling) are `note_coretime_quote(period_index, price)` (Signed, accepted only from the stored coretime quote authority; freeze-exempt), `prune_coretime_quote(period_index)` (Signed: permissionless once the quote's `ops.coretime_quote_ttl` freshness window has expired, quote-authority-anytime otherwise; freeze-exempt), and `set_coretime_authority(quote_authority, renewal_account)` (`FutarchyTreasury` origin) — semantics in [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §4. Events: `StreamOpened/Claimed/Cancelled`, `BudgetLineFunded`, `VitIssued`, `NavHaircutFlagged`, `KeeperBudgetLow`, `KeeperBudgetExhausted { epoch, spent }` (§6.3), `SlotsShrunk` (§4.4, emitted by the decision engine, [05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)), `NavFloorUnmet` (§4.4), plus `Spent`, `ForeignRecovered`, `CoretimeRenewalCalled`, `CoretimeQuoteNoted { period_index, price }`, `CoretimeQuotePruned { period_index }` and `CoretimeAuthoritySet` ([09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §4).

## 2. Genesis economics (B-14, D-15)

### 2.1 VIT supply and allocation

Total supply **1,000,000,000 VIT, 12 decimals**, fixed at genesis; existential deposit 0.01 VIT *(identity constants: [02](02-integration-contract.md), values frozen in [13](13-parameters.md))*.

| Allocation | Share | Amount | Vesting / control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Treasury reserve | 30% | 300,000,000 | Held in `MAIN`; **marked 0 in NAV**; disbursable only via TREASURY-class decisions post-Phase-5 |
| Community distribution | 25% | 250,000,000 | Linear vest over 24 months from Phase-4 arming *(schedule simulation-gated)* |
| Founding team | 20% | 200,000,000 | **4-year linear vest, 1-year cliff**, from TGE |
| Ecosystem / ops fund | 15% | 150,000,000 | Feeds the `ops.*` lines; per-epoch budgets; Phase ≤ 4 administered by the ops multisig under the D-13 exposure caps, Phase ≥ 5 TREASURY-class |
| Phase 3–4 incentive programs | 10% | 100,000,000 | Trading/keeper/reporter bootstrap incentives; backstops the reporter loans of §2.5 |

Vesting is enforced on-chain from genesis via SDK **`pallet-vesting`** (stable2606, `=49.0.0`) linear lock schedules on VIT — genesis-configured balances locks, **one schedule per beneficiary with `begin = cliff end`**: nothing is spendable before the cliff — locked VIT cannot even pay transaction fees (beneficiaries pay fees in USDC per §9 until vested) — then the full locked amount unlocks linearly to the end of the vesting horizon. For the founding team that is zero until TGE + 1 year, then linear to TGE + 4 years (the integer per-block unlock floors, so a sub-VIT remainder MAY clear one block after the 4-year mark — rounding is always against the claimant, never ahead of schedule) — everywhere ≤ the idealized `t/4` catch-up-at-cliff curve, i.e. this reading can only unlock *slower* than the alternative, never faster (the conservative direction; a two-schedule catch-up composition is rejected because `pallet-vesting`'s genesis lock is replace-not-accumulate, which would leave the cliff tranche spendable at genesis). Schedules are denominated in para-blocks at the nominal 6 s block time; slower-than-nominal block production delays unlocks and can never accelerate them. *(Resolved at B3: SDK `pallet-vesting` adopted over an in-pallet schedule store — battle-tested lock accounting, genesis-native schedules, permissionless `vest()`; `pallet-futarchy-treasury` keeps only its §1.3 USDC grant streams.)* The community-distribution and incentive allocations, whose schedules cannot start at genesis (Phase-4 arming is not a genesis-known block), are held at genesis in protocol-derived treasury sub-accounts; the community 24-month schedule is created at Phase-4 arming.

### 2.2 Why 30% reserve is consistent with “VIT marked 0 in NAV”

The reserve exists for values-layer continuity (guardian bonds, conviction depth, future issuance-free grants), not solvency; NAV — the solvency and sizing base — remains USDC-only. No VIT price ever enters NAV, W, or any sizing formula (D-18 reflexivity rule, [05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)).

### 2.3 Issuance mechanism (`iss.inflation_cap`)

- Default issuance schedule: **zero**. VIT is minted only by `issue_vit(amount, line)`, dispatched by a TREASURY-class decision, credited only to `REWARDS` or `ops.*` lines (never to arbitrary accounts).
- Rolling 365-day issuance meter (I-7, monotone): Σ minted ≤ `iss.inflation_cap` × supply-at-window-start; `iss.inflation_cap` = **2%/yr, amendable down only** (kernel bound).
- Every mint emits `VitIssued { amount, line, meter_after }`.

### 2.4 Collator compensation

`collator.comp_epoch` = **2,000 USDC per collator per epoch** (PARAM-adjustable, *normative value: [13](13-parameters.md)*), paid from `ops.collators` at epoch Housekeeping to the session's registered collators pro-rata to authored-block share. Launch load: 5 invulnerables ⇒ 10,000 USDC/epoch ≈ 174,000 USDC/yr — 0.7% of the 25M initial treasury per year; sustainable without issuance.

### 2.5 Initial USDC treasury and funding sequence

- HRMP to Asset Hub opens Phase 2 (Paseo) / Phase 3 (Polkadot); initial USDC transferred in before Phase-4 arming (BE §27.4 carried forward).
- **Funding target: ≥ 25,000,000 USDC before Phase-5 (TREASURY) arming** (D-15). Adequacy arithmetic against the §4 floors:
  - Phase-4 (binding PARAM): full 5-slot PARAM epoch needs NAV ≥ 5 × 13,863 / 0.75% = **9,241,960 USDC** — the Phase-4 arming floor.
  - At 25M NAV the per-epoch POL budget is 0.75% × 25M = **187,500 USDC**, which fits a realistic mixed slate: 1 CODE (103,972) + 1 TREASURY>1% (55,452) + 2 PARAM (2 × 13,863) = **187,150 USDC ≤ 187,500** ✔ (the Baseline book is funded outside this budget, §4.3).
  - 25M > 13.87M = the one-CODE floor, so Phase-6 arming is reachable without further funding **if** NAV has not decayed; the §4 gate re-checks at arming time regardless.

**Reporter-stake bootstrap (B-15-adjacent sequencing, D-15).** Phase-3 arming requires ≥ 3 registered reporters with full `orc.reporter_stake` = 100,000 USDC stakes. The treasury MAY extend **recallable USDC loans** (per-reporter ≤ 75,000 USDC, line backstopped by the 10% incentive allocation) held directly as reporter stake, never withdrawable by the reporter. The reporter MUST post ≥ 25% (≥ 25,000 USDC) of own capital, and **slashing consumes the reporter's own tranche first** — a loan with no reporter skin would deter nothing. Loans are recallable by TREASURY decision or automatically on reporter exit/ejection. Bootstrap line sizing: 3–5 reporters × 75,000 = 225,000–375,000 USDC.

Welfare cold start (`PriorBounds`, epochs 1–12 winsorization) is specified in [05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md) (D-15).

## 3. POL commitments per proposal (recomputed per D-10)

Book inventory per class under the reconciled bound of ≤ 6 books/proposal (2 decision + 4 gate; *bounds normative in [13](13-parameters.md)*). The **POL commitment** charged to `pol.budget_epoch` is the worst-case subsidy loss, Σ over the proposal's books of `b·ln 2` (per-book worst-case maker loss, I-12) — deliberately conservative: only the realized branch's books can actually lose, but the budget meter charges both branches.

| Class | Books | Commitment formula | Commitment (USDC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| PARAM | 2 decision | 2 × 10,000 × ln 2 | **13,863** |
| TREASURY ≤ 1% NAV | 2 decision | 2 × 25,000 × ln 2 | **34,657** |
| TREASURY > 1% NAV | 2 decision + 4 gate | (2 × 25,000 + 4 × 7,500) × ln 2 = 80,000 × ln 2 | **55,452** |
| CODE | 2 decision + 4 gate | (2 × 60,000 + 4 × 7,500) × ln 2 = 150,000 × ln 2 | **103,972** |
| META | 2 decision + 4 gate | (2 × 100,000 + 4 × 7,500) × ln 2 = 230,000 × ln 2 | **159,424** |
| Baseline (per epoch) | 1 | 25,000 × ln 2 (`pol.b_baseline`, §4.3) | **17,329** |

Cash seeding at book creation additionally carries the per-book `headroom` margin ([04](04-markets-and-pricing.md) sizes it); seeding mechanics — one `split`, per-branch `split_scalar` into complete sets — are the per-branch walk of §8 and [03](03-conditional-ledger.md). Committed POL withdraws at settlement; realized cost is the live-branch divergence loss only (≤ half the commitment; the §11.10-equivalent worked example is ≈ 180 USDC for a TREASURY book walked 0.5 → 0.56 — corrected value, frozen in [13](13-parameters.md)).

---

## 4. Minimum-viable NAV and the loud phase gate (B-18, D-15)

### 4.1 Per-class NAV floors

With `pol.budget_epoch` = 0.75% NAV, seeding one proposal of class K requires NAV ≥ commitment(K)/0.0075:

| Gate | Requirement | Floor (USDC) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 × PARAM | 13,863 / 0.0075 | **1,848,400** |
| 1 × TREASURY ≤ 1% | 34,657 / 0.0075 | **4,620,981** |
| 1 × TREASURY > 1% | 55,452 / 0.0075 | **7,393,600** |
| 1 × CODE | 103,972 / 0.0075 | **13,862,944** (~13.9M — the D-15 “one CODE ⇒ ≥ ~14M”) |
| 1 × META | 159,424 / 0.0075 | **21,256,533** |
| Full 5-slot PARAM epoch | 69,315 / 0.0075 | **9,241,960** |
| 5 concurrent META (worst slate) | 797,119 / 0.0075 | **106,282,533** (~106M) |

### 4.2 The gate rule (normative, loud)

**Arming a proposal class (at a rollout phase gate, [09](09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)) REQUIRES published `spendable NAV` ≥ the class floor of §4.1.** The check is explicit, machine-evaluated, and **loud**: an arming attempt below floor fails with `NavFloorUnmet { class, nav, floor }` (event + extrinsic error), and the `nav()` view exposes `floor(class)` values so the FE can render distance-to-floor continuously. Below ~13.9M NAV the chain **cannot pass its own runtime upgrades** — this fact is now surfaced, never silent. Under the §1.2 reserve-health flag, `spendable NAV = 0` and every gate fails (fail-static).

### 4.3 The Baseline book is funded outside `pol.budget_epoch`

`pol.b_baseline` = **25,000 USDC** (default; **simulation-gated — [VERIFY via Phase-0/3 calibration]**), commitment 17,329 USDC/epoch from the dedicated `POL_BASELINE` line, ≤ 4 concurrently live Baseline books (one per live epoch) ⇒ ≤ 69,315 USDC standing. Rationale: (a) the Baseline TWAP is the reject-leg floor input to **every** decision ([05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)) and must exist even in an epoch with zero qualified proposals, so it MUST NOT compete with proposal subsidies under shrink-to-fit; (b) its manipulation resistance must be at least mid-class, hence the TREASURY-tier `b`. This also keeps the §4.1 floors identical to the review's recomputation (which excluded Baseline). Ledger home and settlement path: [03](03-conditional-ledger.md)/[04](04-markets-and-pricing.md) (B-3).

### 4.4 Slots shrink to fit — with an event

Shrink-to-fit stays: if the epoch's qualified slate's total commitment exceeds the POL budget, slots are dropped in reverse bond-priority order until it fits. Every shrink emits `SlotsShrunk { epoch, requested, funded, dropped: Vec<ProposalId> }` and the affected proposals reject as deferred (bond treatment per [06](06-governance-and-guardians.md)); the FE MUST surface shrink events on the epoch dashboard ([11](11-frontend-workflows.md)). Silent zeroing of upgrade capacity is thereby eliminated: capacity loss is always an event plus a rendered NAV-floor distance.

---

## 5. Economic-security sizing (B-8, D-4)

### 5.1 What was wrong (the review's arithmetic, restated)

ADR-14's rule `AttackCost ≥ 3·MEV` had no mechanism: `pol.b`, `dec.v_min`, δ were flat per class. With the A-2 flow model (arbitrage flow F ≈ L/2 per day against sustained mispricing), a TREASURY decision pair at defaults has depth L = 2 × 25,000 × ln 2 = **34,657 USDC**, F ≈ **17,329 USDC/day**, so holding a decision-flipping displacement through the 72 h decision window bleeds at most ≈ 3 × 17,329 = **51,986 USDC**. Against the maximum in-cap prize `trs.cap_proposal` × NAV: at the BE §30.2 example NAV (200,000/2.1% = 9,523,810 ⇒ prize 476,190) the required cost 3 × 476,190 = 1,428,571 exceeds 51,986 by **27.5×**; at 100M NAV (prize 5M, required 15M) by **288.6×**. That 27–290× shortfall is what this section closes.

### 5.2 Primary mechanism: the decide-time cap

New decision-engine step (inserted after the convergence check, before the meters check, in [05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md); reason code `RejectReason::SecuritySizing`):

```
AttackCost̂(p) = F̂(p) · T_dec                         // USDC
  T_dec  = dec.window / 14,400 blocks-per-day           // = 3 days at default
  F̂(p)   = min( L̂(p)/2 ,  F̂_pub )  per day             // conservative minimum
  L̂(p)   = time-averaged effective POL depth of p's decision pair (2·b·ln 2 as seeded, from I-12 telemetry)
          + min( min(ContestCapital_acc(window), ContestCapital_rej(window))
                 ([04](04-markets-and-pricing.md) §7a: time-weighted marked net open interest;
                  the shallower book is binding — the same per-book measure graded against
                  dec.v_min in step 5; SQ-231 amendment: gross traded notional is manipulable
                  by the attacker's own flow and no longer feeds the certificate),
                 sec.flow_cap · (b_acc + b_rej) )       // the C_hold wash ceiling, now gate-bearing
  F̂_pub  = the published measured arbitrage-flow parameter (A-2 obligation,
            measured Phases 3–4); until published, F̂ = L̂/2.

REQUIRE  InCapPrize(p) ≤ AttackCost̂(p) / 3   else Reject(SecuritySizing)
```

`InCapPrize(p)` — the maximum extractable value of a wrongly flipped decision, per class:

| Class | InCapPrize |
|---|---|
| PARAM | certified capability-envelope value of the parameter delta (static classification, [05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)) |
| TREASURY | `ask` (already ≤ `trs.cap_proposal`·NAV by the outflow cap) |
| CODE / META | max(`ask`, envelope), conservatively floored at `trs.cap_proposal`·NAV for runtime-upgrade payloads — an upgrade is assumed able to reach the full per-proposal outflow cap |

NAV in this computation is `spendable NAV` (§1.2): under the reserve-health flag it is 0 and — consistently — no new adoption passes sizing. All inputs are decide-time on-chain measurements; the cap therefore **scales with the value at stake by construction**, which the flat defaults never did.

The inner pair reduction is normatively **MIN**, never SUM: an attacker can flip through the cheaper, shallower decision book, so counting the deeper book would overstate security. §5.4(b) is the arithmetic lock: both books must individually clear `dec.v_min = 400,000`, yet the worked `L̂` adds one 400,000 term (`34,657 + 400,000 = 434,657`), not 800,000.

### 5.3 Secondary mechanism: Ask-scaled liquidity (floors = current defaults)

Piecewise-linear per class in `P = InCapPrize(p)`, with `P_ref(class) = AttackCost̂_default(class)/3` (the largest prize default depth supports; see §5.4):

```
dec.v_min(class, P) = max( v_min_floor(class), 2·P )
pol.b(class, P)     = b_floor(class) · max(1, P / P_ref(class))
δ(class, P)         = min( δ_floor(class) · max(1, P / P_ref(class)) , 0.10 )   // hard kernel cap
```

Floors are the current defaults (*normative values: [13](13-parameters.md)*); the `pol.b` and δ slopes are **simulation-gated [VERIFY in Phase-0 calibration]** — the kernel guarantee below rests on the `v_min` term alone, so slope tuning cannot weaken it.

**Why `v_min = 2·P` closes the rule identically.** If the proposal is decision-grade, measured **contest capital** ([04](04-markets-and-pricing.md) §7a) ≥ `dec.v_min` ≥ 2P, and the `sec.flow_cap` ceiling does not bind at exactly-grade organic depth (next paragraph), so:

```
AttackCost̂ = 1.5 · L̂ ≥ 1.5 · (2·b·ln 2 + 2P) = 3P + 3·b·ln 2  >  3P   ∎
```

i.e., every decision-grade, sizing-passing adoption satisfies `AttackCost̂ ≥ 3·InCapPrize` with a margin of `3·b·ln 2` that itself grows under the `pol.b` scaling. Proposals that cannot attract **held** depth 2× their prize are rejected `SecuritySizing` — status-quo default, exactly the intended failure mode. Since the SQ-231 amendment the 2P term is capital genuinely at risk through the window: supplying it as an attacker means holding net exposure the displacement-and-hold theory (§5.5, `C_hold`) already prices, so the certificate can no longer be self-funded by churn.

**Ceiling non-bindingness (kernel-checked at the consuming engine).** The gate ceiling `sec.flow_cap · (b_acc + b_rej)` must not reject honest exactly-grade proposals: under the **normative `pol.b` seeding of this section** (`b = b_floor · max(1, P/P_ref)`), the binding ratio is `2P / (b_acc + b_rej) = P/b` — for `P ≤ P_ref` it is at most `P_ref/b_floor`, and for `P > P_ref` the scaling holds it constant at exactly `P_ref/b_floor` ≤ 6.7 across the §5.4 defaults table (PARAM/TREASURY/CODE 5.7, META 6.7). Any `sec.flow_cap ≥ 7` therefore leaves the identity intact; **7 is the row's hard minimum** (*normative bound: [13](13-parameters.md)*), and the Phase-0-calibrated value (sim-gated) sits above it. A book seeded at floor `b` while `v_min` carries the `2P` scaling (the §5.4(b) illustration as printed) is **not a configuration the normative seeding produces** — there the ratio can reach 8, which is why the illustration below also records its scaled-seeding form.

### 5.4 Worked recomputation at defaults (normative)

**(a) Maximum in-cap prize, CODE at its NAV floor.** NAV = 13,862,944 (§4.1) ⇒ P = 5% × NAV = **693,147 USDC**.
- Scaled `dec.v_min` = max(600,000, 2 × 693,147) = **1,386,294 USDC**.
- POL depth = 2 × 60,000 × ln 2 = **83,178 USDC**.
- L̂ (at exactly-grade volume) = 83,178 + 1,386,294 = **1,469,472** ⇒ AttackCost̂ = 1.5 × 1,469,472 = **2,204,208 USDC**.
- Requirement 3P = 2,079,441 ≤ 2,204,208 ✔ — holds with margin 124,767 USDC (= 1.5 × 83,178 = 6.0%). Cap check: P = 693,147 ≤ AttackCost̂/3 = 734,736 ✔.

**(b) The §30.2-equivalent TREASURY example.** Ask 200,000 at NAV 9,523,810:
- `dec.v_min` = max(250,000, 400,000) = **400,000**; at floor depth (a conservative illustration that under-states §5.3's own `pol.b` scaling) L̂ = 34,657 + 400,000 = 434,657; AttackCost̂ = **651,986**.
- 3P = 600,000 ≤ 651,986 ✔ (margin 8.7%). Under the old flat defaults this identical proposal had AttackCost ≈ 51,986 vs required 600,000 — an 11.5× shortfall, now closed.
- **Normative-seeding form (SQ-231 consistency note):** §5.3 scales `b = 25,000 · 200,000/142,329 ≈ 35,130` here, so L̂ = 48,700 + 400,000 = 448,700 and AttackCost̂ = 673,050 (margin 12.2%); the `sec.flow_cap` ceiling at its ×7 minimum is 7 · 70,260 = 491,820 ≥ 400,000 — not binding, per §5.3's non-bindingness bound. The floor-depth arithmetic above is kept as the conservative lower bound the identity already clears.

**(c) PARAM at flat defaults (scaling not binding).** L̂ = 2 × 10,000 × ln 2 + 100,000 = 113,863; AttackCost̂ = 170,794; max passable envelope value = **56,931 USDC**. A PARAM delta whose certified envelope exceeds this must either attract more organic volume or fail sizing — the static-classification escape hatch of BE §13 is thereby bounded, not trusted.

**Defaults table `P_ref(class)`** (derived, frozen in [13](13-parameters.md) as derived values): PARAM 56,931 (= 1.5·(13,863 + 100,000)/3); TREASURY 142,329 (= 1.5·(34,657 + 250,000)/3); CODE 341,589 (= 1.5·(83,178 + 600,000)/3); META 669,315 (= 1.5·(138,629 + 1,200,000)/3). Every class term is the **decision-pair** seeded depth `2·b·ln 2` at the [13](13-parameters.md) `pol.b` floors (10k/25k/60k/100k) plus the `dec.v_min` floor — gate-book depth is deliberately excluded from L̂ (§5.2 measures the decision pair only). The superseded PARAM cells (27,726 / 63,863) were a doubling slip: no other row, and no other 08 site (§3 commitments, §4.1 NAV floors), used 4·b·ln 2.

### 5.5 Honesty clause

`AttackCost̂` is an *upper bound* estimate of the manipulation bleed (F̂·T bounds absorbed adverse flow, not realized loss per unit). The SF = 3 divisor, the conservative `min(·, F̂_pub)`, the requirement to hold displacement through full **and** trailing windows with convergence ([05](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)), the `v_min` identity of §5.3, and — since the SQ-231 amendment — the manipulation-resistant contest-capital input with its `sec.flow_cap` ceiling are the compensating margins. Because the gate is an upper bound, the engine also emits the finer *lower-bound* diagnostic **`ManipFloor̂ = C_disp + C_hold`** per decision ([05 §5.6](05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)); it never gates in v1, but its published series is part of the same calibration obligation as F̂ — if `ManipFloor̂` persistently reads below `3·InCapPrize` for adopted proposals, δ and/or the `dec.v_min`/`pol.b` slopes MUST be tightened before caps rise. A-2 remains an **empirical** assumption: F̂ MUST be measured in Phases 3–4 and published before caps rise; deep-pocketed off-system attackers remain the residual (TM-18, [14](14-threat-model.md)).

## 6. Keeper economics (B-med, recomputed)

### 6.1 Crank volume (derivation)

Concurrently trading books = 5 slots × 6 + 1 Baseline = **31** (forecast trading is cut, D-8, so measuring cohorts' books are closed; *bounds: [13](13-parameters.md)*). Observation grid = every 10 blocks:

- **Decision-critical** (72 h decision window, 43,200 blocks): 43,200/10 = 4,320 obs/book × 31 = **133,920**, plus decide/tick/settle/snapshot cranks (order 10²) ⇒ **≥ 134k decision-critical cranks/epoch**.
- **Full trading window** (d5–d18, 187,200 blocks): 18,720 obs/book × 31 = **580,320 ≈ 580k cranks/epoch**.

(On-trade updates advance the grid for free, so these are worst-case zero-organic-trade figures.)

### 6.2 Budget sizing

`keeper.budget_epoch` = **12,000 USDC** (raised from 3,000; *normative value: [13](13-parameters.md)*). Derivation: assumed crank fee ≈ 0.03 USDC **[VERIFY against benchmarked weights + `fee.vit_usdc_rate` at launch]**, `keeper.rebate` ≈ 3× fee ⇒ 133,920 × 0.09 ≈ **12,053 USDC** — the budget covers the full decision-critical load at the 3× profitability multiple (keeper gross margin ≈ 8,000 USDC/epoch over fees paid). The old 3,000 budget covered <25% of decision-critical volume — rational keepers would have stopped mid-window and every decision would have rejected `NotDecisionGrade`.

### 6.3 Meter structure and exhaustion behavior

- Two tranches: **≥ 80% reserved for decision-critical cranks** (decision-window observations, `decide`, `settle_cohort`, `tick`, `snapshot`); ≤ 20% general (out-of-window observations, reaping).
- 80% consumption ⇒ `KeeperBudgetLow`; 100% ⇒ `KeeperBudgetExhausted { epoch, spent }` + RB-KEEPER ops alarm. Cranks remain permissionless and idempotent after exhaustion — rebates stop, nothing else changes.
- Beyond-meter continuity is a funded ops line (`ops.keepers`, §1.1): the ≥ 2 committed keeper operators of the node-roles table run through exhaustion. Full-window coverage at 3× rebate would cost ≈ 580,320 × 0.09 ≈ 52,229 USDC/epoch — deliberately **not** metered: out-of-window observation gaps only degrade chart density, never decisions (staleness counts only inside the decision window, [04](04-markets-and-pricing.md)).

**A-1 restated:** at least one rational, funded keeper exists; if none does, the chain adopts nothing — safe but stagnant. The 12,000 USDC meter plus the ops line is what makes A-1 *economically reasonable* rather than aspirational; it still cannot make it a code-enforced guarantee.

## 7. Intake and bond economics (B-13 economic side, slot monopolization)

New rules (lifecycle owned by [06](06-governance-and-guardians.md); economics here):

1. **10% bond slash — routed to the INSURANCE account, not burned** (USDC is bridged Asset-Hub USDC; burning it would strand backing reserve on Asset Hub — [06](06-governance-and-guardians.md) §4) — on preimage-missing cancellation and on every non-decision-grade outcome; bonds refund in full only on a decision-grade outcome (adopt or reject — rejection is information).
2. **`request_preimage` pinning at qualification** (hygiene half of B-13, in [06](06-governance-and-guardians.md)).
3. **≤ 4 intake entries per account per epoch** (`intake.max_per_account`).

**Cost of the griefing strategies (before → after).** Before: full slot capture + intake denial locked ≈ 109k USDC of *fully refundable* bonds ≈ **$314/epoch** of time-value (5%/yr × 21 d); pure intake denial ≈ $92/epoch.

After, per epoch, at USDC ≈ $1:

| Strategy | Locked | Slashed/epoch (to INSURANCE) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intake denial (64 × PARAM bond 1,000, preimage-missing) | 64,000 | **6,400** (10%) | needs ≥ 16 funded accounts (64 ÷ 4-per-account limit) — ~70× the old $92 |
| Slot capture (5 × ≥ TREASURY/CODE bonds ≥ 25,000, ride to non-decision-grade) | ≥ 125,000 | **≥ 12,500** | bond-priority means matching honest class bonds, not minima |
| Combined monopolization | ≈ 189,000 | **≈ 18,900** | ≈ 60× the old all-in $314 |
| “Refund path”: make the junk decision-grade instead | — | ≥ ≈ 18,000 in fees alone | must self-supply `dec.v_min` contest notional (e.g. 5 × CODE = 3M churn × 2 × 30 bps), plus divergence loss to the POL books, plus 63–66-day scalar capital duration and market risk |

Monopolization is no longer pocket change: every path costs **five figures per epoch, unrecoverable by the attacker** (and INSURANCE-accretive), versus ~$300 of time-value before. Threat row: [14](14-threat-model.md).

## 8. POL seeding flow (per-branch, cap-exempt)

Consistent with the [03](03-conditional-ledger.md) per-branch walk (B-4 fix):

1. `POL` account calls `split(pid, c)` — escrow += c; per-branch supplies `supply(AcceptUsdc) += c`, `supply(RejectUsdc) += c` (dual mint; the mirror is free by construction, so seeding is decision-neutral).
2. Per branch b: `split_scalar(pid, b, c_b)` converts branch-USDC into complete LONG_b+SHORT_b sets held by the book account; gate books receive their per-branch YES/NO complete sets analogously (`GateYes/GateNo` kinds, [03](03-conditional-ledger.md)).
3. Each book's inventory = `b·ln 2 + headroom` of complete sets ([04](04-markets-and-pricing.md) sizes `headroom`); the per-branch identity `escrowed == supply(bUSDC_b) + Q_b` holds at every step — no counter underflows on this flow (the B-4 defect).
4. Book revenue is immediately re-split into complete sets (D-3 revenue recycling), so book solvency is structural, not budgetary.
5. At settlement, POL withdraws; realized subsidy = live-branch divergence loss; `POL` offset receives its 50% fee share.

**Protocol-account exemptions:** the `POL`/book/treasury sub-accounts are exempt from `MaxPositionsPerAccount` = 64 and from the 0.1 USDC per-entry Positions deposit (*bounds: [13](13-parameters.md)*) — a decision pair + 4 gate books across two branches materially exceeds a user cap, and the deposit would be the treasury paying itself. Exemption is by account-list membership in `pallet-constitution`, not by any admin toggle.

---

## 9. Transaction fees (X-14, D-12)

- `pallet-transaction-payment` computes the fee in VIT; `pallet-asset-tx-payment` charges USDC-electing users `fee_usdc = ceil(fee_gov × fee.vit_usdc_rate)`, minimum 1 base unit.
- **`fee.vit_usdc_rate`** (USDC per VIT) is a typed constitution key: bounds **[0.1×, 10×] of the genesis reference** `fee.vit_usdc_rate_ref` (a kernel constant fixed at genesis from the launch reference price — **[VERIFY at TGE pricing; placeholder reference 0.05 USDC/VIT]**), PARAM-adjustable, max Δ ×2, cooldown 1 epoch (*normative row: [13](13-parameters.md)*).
- **USDC-only users are always viable, end-to-end**: the inbound reserve transfer's execution on this chain is paid via the XCM `WeightTrader` selling execution for USDC or DOT; every subsequent local extrinsic — including the outbound `reserve_transfer` exit — is payable in USDC via the rate above. No VIT balance is ever a precondition for any user workflow. The FE fee-currency selector binds to this key ([11](11-frontend-workflows.md)); the guided funding flow is [11](11-frontend-workflows.md)'s D-12 surface.
- Rate-staleness failure mode: if the rate drifts outside honesty (VIT repricing faster than PARAM cadence), the bounded [0.1×, 10×] envelope caps the damage to a 10× fee mispricing in either direction — annoying, never disabling; guardian playbooks are not needed for fee drift.
