# 05 — Welfare Function, State Machines and Decision Engine

**Status: normative component specification. Supersedes the corresponding sections of BACKEND_PLAN.md/FRONTEND_PLAN.md** (BE §8, §9, §12, §13-veto-tests, §14; the welfare/decision rows of §5.2.3–5.2.4, §21, §23). Normative language: RFC 2119. Decisions implemented here: D-4, D-7, D-15 (cold start, collator-D cap), D-18 (gate split, VIT reflexivity), and the B-9/B-10/B-12/B-15 + medium-finding dispositions of [`00-decision-record.md`](./00-decision-record.md).

**Boundary.** This document owns: the proposal state machine, the epoch and cohort machines, the welfare function W and its aggregation/normalization discipline, the gate-veto tests, the settlement score `s`, and the decision engine `decide()`. It references but does not own: ledger mechanics and vault states ([`03-conditional-ledger.md`](./03-conditional-ledger.md)), LMSR/TWAP/Baseline market mechanics ([`04-markets-and-pricing.md`](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)), ratification, guardians and playbooks ([`06-governance-and-guardians.md`](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)), oracle rounds, registries and watchtowers ([`07-oracle-and-disputes.md`](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md)), security-sizing economics and defaults ([`08-treasury-and-economics.md`](./08-treasury-and-economics.md)), execution-guard dispatch checks ([`09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md`](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)), parameter values ([`13-parameters.md`](./13-parameters.md)), and the canonical shared types ([`02-integration-contract.md`](./02-integration-contract.md)). Values quoted here for readability are *(normative value: §13)* unless marked kernel (K).

## 1. Proposal classes and canonical types

### 1.1 Class enum — `Emergency` is deleted (D-7)

```rust
pub enum ProposalClass { Param, Treasury, Code, Meta, Constitutional }
```

`ProposalClass::Emergency` is **removed** from the enum, from the class-derivation table, and from every state-machine and §21-equivalent row. Emergencies are handled exclusively by guardian playbooks ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)) — which is what every emergency path in the source spec already did in practice; no lifecycle, bond, market set, or decision rule ever existed for the class. Consequence: the ADR-3 classifier-completeness obligation ("class derived mechanically from call-domain classification, never proposer-declared downward") is now satisfiable — every classifiable batch maps to one of the five live classes, and CONSTITUTIONAL-class subjects route to the values track with **no markets** (referendum path). The classifier MUST reject (T4, `ProposalCancelled`) any batch whose domains map to no class.

### 1.2 `Proposal` — new fields (B-med: decide() fields)

The canonical `Proposal` (layout frozen as part of the [doc 02](./02-integration-contract.md) contract "by inclusion in `futarchy-primitives`") gains three fields the engine consumes (`ask`, `decide_at`, `rerun`); the base field list, which 02 and this document previously deferred to each other without either enumerating it, is **frozen here in full** — this declaration order is the SCALE layout:

```rust
/// Generic over the runtime `AccountId` (concrete instantiation: AccountId32, 02 §8);
/// carried by `futarchy-primitives` per 02 §2.
pub struct Proposal<AccountId> {
    pub id: ProposalId,
    pub proposer: AccountId,
    pub class: ProposalClass,
    pub state: ProposalState,
    pub epoch: EpochId,                     // creation epoch — the schedule anchor (§2.3)
    pub submitted_at: BlockNumber,
    pub payload_hash: H256,                 // pinned at qualification (06; re-checked 09 §1.2(2))
    pub payload_len: u32,                    // preimage byte length; (hash, len) is the pinned
                                             // commitment (09 §1.2(2); read by decide()'s §5.6
                                             // preimage check and listed in 09 §1.1's queued fields)
    pub ask: Balance,            // committed USDC outflow (TREASURY; 0 otherwise). Consumed by
                                 // bond formula, security sizing (§5.6), Ask-scaled liquidity (doc 08)
    pub bond: Balance,                      // class bond held (13 §1 `prop.bond`)
    pub resources: BoundedVec<[u8; 8], 8>,  // declared resource-domain keys (bound: 13 §4 "Resource locks")
    pub metric_spec: MetricSpecVersion,     // creation-time spec version (I-16)
    pub decide_at: BlockNumber,  // absolute; computed and stored at qualification from the
                                 // creation-time epoch schedule (§2.3); updated only by T8/T13
    pub rerun: bool,             // set at rerun open (T13); selects the 2×POL / δ+1pp regime
    pub extended: bool,                     // per-pair extension consumed (§2.1 T8)
    pub delayed_once: bool,                 // guardian delay-once consumed (06)
    pub markets: Option<MarketSet>,         // book ids once seeded (04)
    pub maturity: Option<BlockNumber>,      // execution-queue maturity (09 §1.2(1))
    pub grace_end: Option<BlockNumber>,     // execution grace deadline (09 §1.2(1))
    pub version_constraint: Option<RuntimeVersionConstraint>, // layout: 09 §1.2(3)
    pub decision: Option<DecisionOutcome>,  // set at decide()/terminal transition
}
```

### 1.3 `DecisionOutcome` and `RejectReason` (canonical)

```rust
/// Canonical name per doc 02 (the FE's `DecisionOutcomeCode` is renamed to this).
pub enum DecisionOutcome { Adopt, Reject(RejectReason), Extend }

pub enum RejectReason {
    NotDecisionGrade, GateVetoSurvival, GateVetoSecurity, HurdleNotMet,
    ConvergenceFailed, SecondExtensionFailed, ProcessHold, ConstitutionViolation,
    ResourceConflict, RateLimited, VetoUpheldByReview, StaleQueue, PayloadReverted,
    // new (D-4, D-5, D-18):
    NotRatified,         // grace ended without a Passed RatificationRecord (SQ-163)
    SecuritySizing,      // InCapPrize > AttackCost̂ / 3 (§5.6)
    AttestationMissing,  // CODE/META attestation record absent or below attestor quorum
    // new (contract v6, SQ-166):
    RolloverExhausted,   // §2.1 T26: second deferral, rollover allowance spent
}
```

**Every variant has exactly one producing site, with one deliberate exception** (B-med: RejectReason; SQ-3): `AttestationMissing` is produced at **two** sites — `decide()` step 10 at decide time (T10) and the execution guard's dispatch-time re-check (T16) — because a queue-time `AttestationRecord` can be revoked, or have a challenge resolved against it, *after* queue time, which [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(5) and [doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md) I-19 require the guard to catch at `execute`. The producer map is otherwise normative — an implementation MUST NOT emit a variant from any site not listed below:

| Variant | Producer | Transition |
|---|---|---|
| `NotDecisionGrade` | `decide()` step 3 (gate books invalid) or step 5 (welfare books invalid, second insufficiency) | T10 |
| `GateVetoSurvival` / `GateVetoSecurity` | `decide()` step 4 | T10 |
| `HurdleNotMet` | `decide()` steps 6–7 (converged, hurdle failed) | T10 |
| `ConvergenceFailed` | `decide()` step 8 | T10 |
| `SecondExtensionFailed` | `decide()` steps 6–8: full/trailing disagreement recurring while `p.extended` (§5.4) | T10 |
| `ProcessHold` | `decide()` step 2; force-reject under VOID / stale-epoch / **active `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE`** (T20) | T10, T20 |
| `ConstitutionViolation` | `decide()` step 1 (preimage mismatch at decide time) | T10 |
| `ResourceConflict` | `decide()` step 1 (locks lost) | T10 |
| `SecuritySizing` | `decide()` step 9 | T10 |
| `AttestationMissing` | `decide()` step 10 (CODE/META) at decide time; **and** the execution guard's dispatch-time re-check when the queue-time `AttestationRecord` was revoked/challenge-resolved-against-it post-queue ([doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(5), [doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md) I-19) | T10, T16 |
| `RateLimited` | `decide()` step 10 (constitutional meters/spacing) | T10 |
| `NotRatified` | execution guard / epoch tick: **grace end reached with no Passed `RatificationRecord`**. An earlier `execute` against an absent or unpassed ratification errors (`NotRatified`) and leaves the proposal `Queued`, retryable through `grace_end` — it is not itself a transition (SQ-163; [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §2.2 mechanics, [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(4) dispatch check) | T16 |
| `StaleQueue` | execution guard: version-constraint mismatch; meter contention past grace | T16 |
| `VetoUpheldByReview` | guardian review flow: the mandatory retrospective review of a `delay_once` concludes with an upheld-veto verdict before the rerun opens — the `ratify`-track referendum enacts `guardian.uphold_veto(action_id)`, the single producing site ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §5.4) | T24 |
| `PayloadReverted` | execution-failure recording: carried in `ExecutionFailed { reason }` and in `ExecutionRecord.result` at T18; copied into the cohort's `DecisionRecord` when T22 fires | T18 (annotation), T22 |
| `RolloverExhausted` | epoch `tick`: the **second** T6 deferral of the same proposal, the single rollover allowance already spent (*T5/T6 ordering and rollover exhaustion*, §2.1) — a terminal cancellation with a full refund, never a deferral | T26 |

### 1.4 Canonical resource-domain keys (B1b; resolves the SQ-172/SQ-183 screening gap)

`Proposal.resources` (§1.2) declares the payload's resource-domain footprint; screening verifies the declaration mechanically (§2.1 T4/T5) and the execution guard re-derives its own surfaces at dispatch ([doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(8)/(11), I-11). The canonical payload → footprint mapping is fixed here; the frontend composes declarations with the same rule ([doc 02](./02-integration-contract.md) carries the `Proposal` type by inclusion; this section owns the key encoding).

**Leaf set.** Decode the committed payload under the [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(11) bounds and recurse exclusively through `utility.batch_all` (≤ `MAX_NESTED` = 4 levels, ≤ 16 calls total, [13](./13-parameters.md) §2). Payloads dispatch under a single class origin, and the best-effort batch variants (`utility.batch`, `utility.force_batch`) are rejected by the class-origin dispatcher (SQ-96) — so no other call-carrying wrapper is payload-admissible: any other wrapper, and any leaf outside the family table below, makes the batch **unclassifiable** (T4, §1.1).

**Key encoding.** A resource key is 8 bytes: `key[0]` is the domain-family tag; `key[1..8]` is the first 7 bytes of `blake2_256(discriminator)` for keyed families and `[0u8; 7]` for singleton families.

| Tag | Family | Payload leaves | Discriminator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | Parameter record | `constitution.set_param(key, _)`, `constitution.amend_registry(key, …)` | the 16-byte `ParamKey` |
| `0x02` | Capability record | `constitution.set_capability(record)` | SCALE(`record.class`) ++ SCALE(`record.capability`) |
| `0x03` | Runtime code | `system.authorize_upgrade(_)` | — (singleton) |
| `0x04` | Market template | `market.set_template(…)`\* | — (singleton) |
| `0x05` | Oracle config | `oracle.set_config(…)`\* | — (singleton) |
| `0x06` | Registry config | `registry.set_config(…)`\* | SCALE(instance discriminant: `u8`; incident = 0, milestone = 1) |
| `0x07` | Treasury beneficiary | `futarchy_treasury.spend(_, dest, _)`, `futarchy_treasury.open_stream(_, recipient, …)` | SCALE(`AccountId`) of the beneficiary |
| `0x08` | Treasury stream | `futarchy_treasury.cancel_stream(id)` | SCALE(`id: u64`) |
| `0x09` | Budget line | `futarchy_treasury.fund_budget_line(line, _)` | SCALE(`line`) |
| `0x0A` | XCM trap recovery | `polkadot_xcm.claim_assets(assets, beneficiary)` | — (singleton) |

\* Enumerated by the [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §3.2 matrix; a runtime whose live call surface does not (yet) include a listed call simply never produces that family. The table is exhaustive over the belief-payload-admissible surface: a leaf outside it has no key and the batch is unclassifiable (T4) — which structurally enforces the [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §1 / I-8 values-scope exclusion (values-scope calls appear in no row).

**Why trap recovery is a singleton family (normative; SQ-244/SQ-316).** [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §6.1 requires protocol-keyed `AssetTrap` entries to be reclaimed by a TREASURY-class call and [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §3.2 carries the matching authority row — but the payload had no resource key, so screening classified it unclassifiable and cancelled it (T4), leaving the mandated recovery path unreachable end-to-end. The key is deliberately **singleton** rather than derived from the trapped `(assets, beneficiary)` pair: recovery is rare, so serialising all recoveries behind one lock costs only liveness, whereas a key derived from a *versioned* asset set risks two distinct traps sharing a truncated digest through an encoding or XCM-version alias — and an under-locked trap is a **safety** cost, not a liveness one. Serialising is the G-1 direction. Two consequential rules follow. **Ask derivation:** `claim_assets` moves already-owned assets out of the trap register and creates **no** treasury outflow, so its derived Treasury ask is exactly **zero**; this is the one admissible zero-outflow Treasury leaf and MUST NOT be generalized into "unknown leaves ask zero". **Class safety:** the base call-filter projection stays **Public** — a Signed origin reclaiming its own self-keyed trap is 09 §6.1's ordinary path and must not require governance — while belief-execution admission is separately gated, the leaf being payload-admissible **only** for `ProposalClass::Treasury` carrying the Treasury-spend capability. Without that explicit rule the footprint arm would let a PARAM/CODE/META payload inherit the generic Public allowance, which is exactly the class confusion [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §1 / I-8 excludes.

**Footprint and the screening rule.** `footprint(payload)` = the deduplicated set of leaf keys. If `|footprint| > 8`, the batch is unclassifiable (the [13](./13-parameters.md) §4 lock bound). "Domain mismatch" in T4 means **set inequality**: the declared `resources` MUST equal `footprint(payload)` as a set (order- and duplicate-insensitive). Set inequality in either direction is a **false resource declaration** carrying T4's 100%-slash disposition — under-declaration understates the footprint; over-declaration squats locks the payload never touches ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §4 rule 5 prices both). Canonical presentation (recommended for composers, not consensus-enforced): ascending bytewise, no duplicates. Class derivation stays the §1.1 mechanical rule over the [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §3.2 matrix (for family `0x01`, `set_param`'s class follows the registered key's class; the `amend_registry` scope contest is SQ-150 and deliberately not resolved here); a batch admitting no single class origin — or an empty batch — is class-less → T4 with the §2.1 refund-vs-slash taxonomy.

**Collision domain.** Distinct families never collide (tag byte). Within a family, keys collide iff their truncated 56-bit `blake2_256` digests collide. A collision can only **over-lock** (a spurious T6 conflict/rollover): class admission and values-scope exclusion are decided on leaves before any key is computed, so no collision can admit an inadmissible call or forge a class — a liveness cost, never a safety cost. Targeted second-preimage grief costs ~2⁵⁶ hash evaluations with a bond at risk; accepted. A CI test asserts zero collisions across the concrete key universe (all registered `ParamKey`s × both `0x01` leaves, the enumerable discriminators, and the singletons).

**Lock persistence to dispatch.** Locks acquired at T5 are released only at terminal transitions, and every terminal transition of a queued proposal cancels its queue entry atomically (§2.1, [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.1) — so [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(8)'s "locks still held" is structural on the epoch side; the guard's step-8 meter locks and step-11 call-domain re-derivation (I-11) re-check the mechanically derived surfaces at dispatch time.

## 2. Proposal state machine

### 2.1 Transition table (normative; anything absent is impossible and MUST error)

Changes vs. the superseded table (B-12): **T21/T22/T23 added**, **T13 restructured** so a guardian rerun re-enters `Extended` (satisfying `decide()`'s `is_trading_or_extended` precondition), **T24 added** to wire `VetoUpheldByReview`, T16 generalized to carry `NotRatified` (and, per SQ-3, `AttestationMissing` from the guard's dispatch-time re-check), T20 gains its event (X-11f), Emergency triggers deleted (D-7).

| # | From → To | Trigger (call) | Origin | Timing / guard | Deposit / slash | Events |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | ∅ → Submitted | `epoch.submit` | Signed | Intake phase only; queue < 64; ≤ 4 entries/epoch/account ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)); bond held | class bond held | `ProposalSubmitted` |
| T2 | Submitted → Cancelled | `epoch.withdraw` | proposer | before Qualify | full refund | `ProposalWithdrawn` |
| T3 | Submitted → Screening | `tick` | keeper | Qualify phase start | — | `ScreeningStarted` |
| T4 | Screening → Cancelled | `tick` (static checks fail: preimage missing/unpinned/oversized, domain mismatch, kernel violation, unclassifiable batch, bond insufficient after class bump) | keeper | — | **100% slash** on constitution violation or false resource declaration; **10% slash to INSURANCE** on preimage-missing (B-13, [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)) | `ProposalCancelled(reason)` |
| T5 | Screening → Qualified | `tick` (checks pass; slot won by bond priority among ≤ N_active; resource locks acquired; `decide_at` computed and stored per §3.3) | keeper | Qualify phase | — | `ProposalQualified` |
| T6 | Screening → Submitted (rollover) | `tick` (no slot / lock conflict) | keeper | **first** deferral only; a second one takes T26 instead | — | `ProposalDeferred` |
| T7 | Qualified → Trading | `tick` (markets deployed, POL seeded, vault opened — [doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md)/[04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)) | keeper | Seed phase | — | `MarketsOpened` |
| T8 | Trading → Extended | `decide` (first insufficiency or full/trailing disagreement, §5.4) or first TWAP stale event ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)) | keeper | Decide phase; at most once per proposal (one shared extension budget); `decide_at += dec.extension` (3 d, K) | — | `DecisionExtended` |
| T9 | Trading/Extended → Queued | `decide` (all §5 checks pass) | keeper | `now ≥ decide_at` | — | `ProposalQueued { payload_hash, maturity }` |
| T10 | Trading/Extended → Rejected(r) | `decide` | keeper | — | bond refunded (rejection is information); then T21 fires | `ProposalRejected(r)` |
| T11 | Queued → Suspended | `guardian.delay_once` | GuardianHold | within timelock; once ever per proposal | — | `ProposalDelayed { justification_hash }` |
| T12 | Suspended → Rerun | `tick` | keeper | guardian review window closed without an upheld veto (else T24) | — | `RerunScheduled` |
| T13 | Rerun → Extended | `tick` at the next epoch's Seed phase: books **reopen at 2× POL**, hurdle **δ+1 pp**, TWAP accumulators reset, positions intact; sets `extended := true`, `rerun := true`, `decide_at := reopen_block + dec.extension` (3 d) | keeper | next epoch's Seed | 2× POL committed | `RerunOpened` |
| T14 | Queued → Executed | `execution_guard.execute` | Signed (keeper) | `maturity ≤ now ≤ maturity + grace(class)`; all [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) dispatch re-validations pass **including ratification Passed for CODE/META (D-5)** | — | `Executed { record }` |
| T15 | Queued → Expired | `tick` | keeper | grace elapsed with no execute attempt succeeding **and no T16 cause applies** — T16's specific causes are evaluated first (see *Grace-end precedence* below) | bond refunded; then T21 fires | `MandateExpired` |
| T16 | Queued → Rejected(r) | `tick` / `execute` failure paths; r ∈ { `StaleQueue` (version-constraint mismatch after an intervening upgrade; repeated meter contention past grace), `NotRatified` (grace end reached with no Passed `RatificationRecord`; a *pre-grace* execute attempt against an absent or unpassed ratification errors and leaves the proposal `Queued` — SQ-163), `AttestationMissing` (the queue-time `AttestationRecord` was revoked or a late challenge resolved against it post-queue — [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §1.2(5), [doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md) I-19) } | keeper | — | refund; then T21 fires | `ProposalRejected(r)` |
| T17 | Executed → Measuring | automatic in T14; vault `resolve(Accept)` | — | — | proposer reward paid | `MeasurementStarted(cohort)` |
| T18 | Queued → FailedExecuted | `execute` payload dispatch error (payload atomically reverted; proposal state advances) | — | retry window **72 h**, then T22; ACCEPT branch stays live | 50% bond slash (proposer owns executability) | `ExecutionFailed { reason: PayloadReverted }` |
| T19 | Measuring → Settled | `settle_cohort` (§7) | keeper | cohort epoch e+2 snapshot finalized + challenge closed; settlement at e+3 Housekeeping | — | `CohortSettled { s }` |
| T20 | any non-terminal pre-Executed → Rejected(ProcessHold) | `tick` **or `decide()`** under VOID conditions, stale-epoch force-reject (`StaleEpochBound = 7 d`), or an active `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE` ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §6.3) — the disposition is identical whichever observes the proposal first (SQ-98) | keeper | if a vault exists it transitions to `Voided` ([doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md), D-1) — **no measurement**; queued executions cancel (I-15) | refund | `ProposalForceRejected { pid, reason: ProcessHold }` (+ ledger `VaultVoided`, [doc 02](./02-integration-contract.md)) — the frozen T20 event; ordinary `ProposalRejected` belongs to T10/T16/T24 (SQ-84) |
| **T21** | **Rejected(r) / Expired → Measuring** | automatic, same block as entering Rejected/Expired | — | fires iff markets were deployed and the vault is open (not `Voided`): vault `resolve(Reject)`; the REJECT branch trades through measurement and settles — **the most common lifecycle path** | — | `MeasurementStarted(cohort)` |
| **T22** | **FailedExecuted → Measuring** | `tick` | keeper | 72 h retry window exhausted; vault `resolve(Accept)` — measured as **executed-with-failure** (the adopted world, including the failure's consequences, is what W measures); `DecisionRecord` carries `PayloadReverted` | — | `MeasurementStarted(cohort)` |
| **T23** | **FailedExecuted → Executed** | `execution_guard.execute` (retry) | Signed (keeper) | within the 72 h retry window; full dispatch re-validation repeats | slash from T18 not reversed | `Executed { record }` (then T17) |
| **T24** | **Suspended → Rejected(VetoUpheldByReview)** | guardian review flow: the retrospective `ratify`-track review of the delay enacts `guardian.uphold_veto(action_id)` ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §5.4) | values enactment (via guardian pallet) | before the rerun opens; consumes the guardian's delay allowance permanently | bond refunded; then T21 fires | `ProposalRejected(VetoUpheldByReview)` |
| **T25** | **Trading/Extended/Queued → Extended** | `guardian.force_rerun(pid)` ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §5.3) | GuardianHold | pre-execution only; **one guardian rerun of either kind per proposal, ever** (shared with T11/T13); a queued mandate is cancelled in the same transaction (I-15); books reopen and all proposal-book TWAP accumulators/checkpoints reset; positions and POL stay intact; sets `rerun := true`, `extended := true`, `decide_at := reopen_block + dec.extension` | — | `ForceRerun { pid, justification_hash, window_end }` (guardian pallet) |
| **T26** | **Screening → Cancelled(RolloverExhausted)** | `tick` (no slot / lock conflict) against a proposal that has **already taken T6 once** — the rollover allowance is per proposal, not per cause (*T5/T6 ordering and rollover exhaustion*, below) | keeper | evaluated **in place of** T6, never after it: no proposal takes T6 twice | full refund — losing a slot is contention, not misconduct | `ProposalCancelled { pid, reason: RolloverExhausted }` |

Rules carried forward unchanged: idempotency (every keeper call re-invoked in the same state is a no-op returning `Ok` with a `NoOp` event or a benign error; no transition is repeatable with side effects); **no rejection, timeout, veto, or expiry path enqueues execution** (I-15, checked by state-machine model checking, [doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md)).

**T4 disposition taxonomy (normative; SQ-191 resolution, 2026-07-20).** The governing principle is that **confiscation requires a verified culpable act**; any static failure that is residual, ambiguous, or unverifiable by the screening implementation resolves to cancellation with a **full refund** (G-1). Concretely:

- **100 % slash** — a *verified* constitution violation or a *verified* false resource declaration ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §4). This includes a payload whose declared footprint does not match the derived one, a capability violation, an over-large resource declaration, and — the case SQ-191 raised — a payload carrying **no classifiable domain together with a non-empty resource declaration**, which is a false declaration on its face.
- **10 % slash to INSURANCE** — preimage missing, unpinned, or oversized at screening (B-13). The proposer controls preimage availability, so this is culpable, but it destroys no protocol state.
- **Full refund + cancel** — everything else, including: a payload with **no classifiable domain and an empty resource declaration** (a verifiable no-op / domain mismatch, which 06 §4 does not name as confiscable), an undecodable payload, a call the classifier cannot re-derive while its footprint is otherwise admissible, no bond floor defined for the derived class, a bond that fell below a floor raised after submission, and a TREASURY ask that does not match its declared in-cap prize.

Rejection at screening is information, not misconduct: the refund arm is the default and the two slash arms are the enumerated exceptions.

**T5/T6 ordering and rollover exhaustion (normative; SQ-91 resolution, 2026-07-20).** Qualification ranks candidates **bond-descending, then `pid`-ascending** — the tie-break is the deterministic submission order, so equal bonds never depend on iteration order. A candidate that wins no slot, or whose resource locks conflict, takes T6 and rolls over **exactly once**: the first deferral returns it to `Submitted` re-anchored to the next epoch (T6, `ProposalDeferred`); a second deferral of the same proposal cancels it with a full refund (**T26**, `ProposalCancelled { reason: RolloverExhausted }`). The exhausting deferral is **terminal and MUST report itself as such** — emitting `ProposalDeferred` for it would enter a dead proposal into event-derived history as still live (SQ-166). The single rollover allowance is **per proposal, not per cause** — a proposal deferred once by slot contention and then demoted by the [doc 08](./08-treasury-and-economics.md) §4.4 POL-budget shrink-to-fit has already consumed its allowance and cancels.

**T20 stale-epoch anchor (normative; SQ-86 resolution, 2026-07-20).** `StaleEpochBound` measures **epoch staleness, not per-proposal lifetime**: it is the overdue margin on the persisted **next phase boundary**, so a chain whose clock has stopped advancing trips it regardless of how new any individual proposal is. When the bound is exceeded the engine **latches a high-water proposal-id snapshot**; force-rejection then applies to exactly those proposals with `id ≤ cutoff`, and proposals submitted after the latch are immune (they never observed the stale epoch). The latch is **suppressed while the dead-man switch is armed or paused and during a recovery epoch** — a stalled clock that the dead-man already owns must not also be attributed to epoch staleness (§4.8) — and it **self-clears** once no proposal at or below the cutoff remains force-rejectable, so the mechanism is a bounded drain rather than a permanent mode.

**Grace-end precedence: T16 before T15 (normative; SQ-164).** At the tick where grace expires, a ratification-requiring proposal with no Passed `RatificationRecord` satisfies **both** T15 (generic expiry) and T16 (`NotRatified`). **T16's specific causes MUST be evaluated first**, so such a proposal becomes `Rejected(NotRatified)` and never `Expired`. The same ordering applies to T16's other causes (`StaleQueue`, `AttestationMissing`). The rule is that a *known terminal cause must not collapse into generic expiry*: the two dispositions carry the same refund but a different `DecisionRecord`, and the archive is the only place the reason survives. Absent this ordering the reason-code truth table (§5.5) would be non-deterministic at exactly the moment it matters most.

**Rerun finality.** After T13 **or T25**, the proposal decides through T9/T10 exactly like any Extended proposal. The outcome is final and undelayable structurally, not by a special rule: `delayed_once` is already true so T11 cannot fire again, and `extended` is already true so no further extension is reachable (§5.4). A rerun that fails grade or hurdle rejects; it never re-extends. The **one guardian rerun per proposal** allowance is shared across both kinds: a proposal that took the T11→T12→T13 delay-then-rerun path cannot then take T25, and vice versa ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §5.3).

**Measurement-time cohort VOID has no proposal transition (normative; SQ-162).** Its absence from this table is deliberate, not a gap. When a cohort VOIDs during measurement ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md) §10, §7 below), the **cohort** moves to `CohortInfo.status = Void` and the affected **vaults** move `Resolved → Voided` ([doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §2.3) — the proposals themselves do not move, and **their recorded decisions stand** (07 §10: "decisions already made stand"). A `Measuring` proposal has already been decided and executed or rejected; overwriting that decision would falsify the archive, which is the only durable record of what the market concluded. T20 is **not** the transition for these proposals: T20 is scoped to *pre-Executed* states and applies, in the same epoch-VOID transaction, only to that epoch's proposals which have not yet been decided — those have no decision to preserve. Normatively: **on measurement-time cohort VOID an already-decided proposal MUST retain its state and its recorded `DecisionOutcome`, and MUST NOT emit a per-proposal rejection event**; only same-epoch proposals that have not reached a decision take T20.

**Terminal states.** `Settled`, `Cancelled`, `Expired`-without-vault (impossible — Expired implies Queued implies markets; listed for completeness), and `Rejected` where no vault exists (pre-Seed rejections via T20) or the vault is `Voided`. `Rejected` and `Expired` with a healthy vault are **transient** — T21 fires in the same block. This closes the superseded table's gap in which rejected and expired proposals' vaults could never resolve and their cohort settlement was unreachable (B-12).

(T20 force-reject edges from every pre-Executed state, and the Voided-vault terminal `Rejected`, are omitted from the drawing for legibility; they are normative per §2.1. Measurement-time cohort VOID draws no edge here because it is a cohort/vault transition, not a proposal one — §2.1, SQ-162.)

## 3. Epoch and cohort state machines

### 3.1 Phase schedule — offsets as fractions of `epoch.length` (B-med: epoch.length)

`epoch.length` is META-amendable *(bounds: §13; floor **201,600 blocks = 14 days**, K)* and MUST be a multiple of 21 blocks so all phase boundaries are exact. Phase offsets are **kernel-fixed rational fractions n/21 of `epoch.length`** — they scale automatically with any length change; there are no absolute phase offsets anywhere in storage. At the default `epoch.length = 302,400` blocks (21 days, 14,400 blocks/day at 6 s — frozen constants, [doc 13](./13-parameters.md)):

| Phase | Fraction of L | Blocks at L = 302,400 | Days | Work | Bound |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intake | [0, 3/21) | 0 – 43,200 | d0–d3 | submissions accepted | queue ≤ 64 |
| Qualify | [3/21, 4/21) | 43,200 – 57,600 | d3–d4 | static checks, class derivation, bond-priority slotting (≤ 5), resource locks | ≤ 64 screenings in ≤ TickBatch chunks |
| Seed | [4/21, 5/21) | 57,600 – 72,000 | d4–d5 | vaults, decision pairs, gate markets, Baseline; POL seeded; rerun reopenings (T13) | ≤ 5·6 + 1 markets |
| **Trade** | **[5/21, 18/21)** | **72,000 – 259,200** | **d5–d18 (13 days)** | trading; observations every 10 blocks ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)) | crank-driven |
| Decide window | [18/21·L − dec.window, 18/21·L) | 216,000 – 259,200 | final 72 h | TWAP decision window accrues; trailing window = final `dec.trailing` (24 h) | O(1) checkpoints |
| Decide | at 18/21 | 259,200 | d18 | `decide(pid)` per slot; extension = +3 d for that pair only (into next epoch's calendar; bounded overlap) | ≤ 5 decisions |
| Review (timelock) | from decide, per class | — | d18 + T(class) | guardian window; values review for META/upgrade | — |
| Execute | per-proposal maturity | — | — | permissionless `execute()` within grace | ≤ 5 |
| Housekeeping | [20/21, 1) | 288,000 – 302,400 | d20–d21 | cohort settlement for epoch e−3 (§7), market reaping, normalization-constant freeze for e+1, Baseline(e+1) prep | batched cranks |

The Trade phase labels are corrected to **d5–d18** (offsets 72,000–259,200 = 13 days) — the superseded "d4–d18" label contradicted its own offsets (B-low). `dec.window` and `dec.trailing` remain absolute block-count parameters anchored to Trade close; constraint (checked at parameter change): `dec.window ≤ 13/21 · epoch.length`.

### 3.2 `epoch.length` changes take effect next epoch; in-flight cohorts keep their creation-time schedule

A META change to `epoch.length` enacted during epoch e becomes effective at the **open of epoch e+1** — never mid-epoch. All schedule-derived absolute block numbers for a proposal/cohort (`trade_open`, `trade_close`, `decide_at`, extension deadline, measurement-epoch boundaries, settlement target) are computed **once, at qualification/cohort creation, from the then-effective length**, stored in `CohortSchedule`, and are never retro-modified by a later length change — exactly the MetricSpec freezing discipline (I-16). Measurement epochs e+1/e+2 for an in-flight cohort are the epochs as they actually occur (possibly under the new length); only the cohort's *own stored offsets* are frozen.

### 3.3 Cohort machine (carried forward)

`CohortInfo { epoch, proposals: BoundedVec<ProposalId, 5>, status: Measuring{until} | AwaitingOracle | Settling{cursor} | Settled | Void }`. At most 4 cohorts non-terminal simultaneously (2 measuring + 1 awaiting oracle/challenge + 1 settling) — I-21. Measurement horizon **k = 2** (frozen): cohort e measures over epochs e+1 and e+2; Snapshot(e+2) finalizes and survives its **72 h** challenge window ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md)) during epoch e+3's opening days; **settlement at e+3** Housekeeping via the single settlement path of §7. `settle_cohort(e, batch)` processes ≤ 100 (market, position-total) items per call, cursor-resumable; settlement completeness is a precondition for cohort reap; reap is a precondition for pruning a snapshot out of the retained window.

**Snapshot retention arithmetic (normative; SQ-200 resolution, 2026-07-20).** The retained window is **20 snapshots deep** (`MAX_SNAPSHOTS`, [doc 13](./13-parameters.md) §4) and that bound governs. The prune cutoff is expressed against the **current epoch index at prune time**, not against a cohort index: pruning removes every snapshot with index **≤ current − 20**, i.e. it uses the cutoff `current − 19`. This retains 19 snapshots and leaves exactly **one free slot** for the epoch's own record. The superseded phrasing ("reap is a precondition for pruning snapshot e−20") was ambiguous about whether `e` meant the cohort epoch or the settling epoch, and under the cohort reading it implied ≥ 22 retained epochs — unsatisfiable at `MAX_SNAPSHOTS = 20`. A cutoff of `current − 20` retains a full window and **permanently jams** `record_snapshot` (which requires strict spare capacity), deadlocking settlement and ultimately tripping the dead-man switch (§4.8). Implementations MUST use the `current − 19` cutoff; the reap-before-prune ordering is unchanged.

```
epoch:        e        e+1      e+2      e+3
cohort e:     trade →  measure  measure  settle
cohort e+1:            trade →  measure  measure   (settles e+4)
cohort e−1:   measure  measure  settle
```

## 4. Welfare function

### 4.1 Composite (normative; carried forward from ADR-6)

```
W_e = g(S_e; θS⁻, θS⁺) · g(C_e; θC⁻, θC⁺) · GeoComposite(P_e, A_e)
GeoComposite(P, A) = max(P, ε)^{wP} · max(A, ε)^{wA},   wP + wA = 1,   ε = 0.01
g(x; lo, hi) = 0                              if x < lo
             = 3t² − 2t³,  t = (x − lo)/(hi − lo)   if lo ≤ x < hi
             = 1                              if x ≥ hi
Defaults (normative values: §13): θS⁻ = 0.90, θS⁺ = 0.98, θC⁻ = 0.85, θC⁺ = 0.95, wP = 0.60, wA = 0.40
```

All pillar values, gates and W in `FixedU64` (1e9) on [0,1]. Floors θ⁻ are kernel-entrenched: **raising** a knee (tightening) is CONSTITUTIONAL-class; **lowering** one (loosening) requires the entrenched 80%-supermajority values path ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)). **"Loosening" means un-tightening only (normative; SQ-78):** the entrenched path can walk a previously raised knee back down **to, but never below, its launch value** — θS⁻ = 0.90 and θC⁻ = 0.85 are hard genesis floors that no track and no supermajority can breach ([doc 13](./13-parameters.md), entrenched-floors row). The two statements are one rule, not two: 13 fixes the floor, this section fixes which track may move a knee in which direction. An amendment below the launch value MUST be rejected by the parameter validator regardless of origin.

**Settlement score:** `s = GeoMean(W_{e+1}, W_{e+2})` over the cohort's k = 2 horizon — already in [0,1]; no anchor-ratio mapping (ADR-6). Computation discipline in §4.6; consumption in §7.

**Reflexivity exclusions (kernel):** no input may be a price from the protocol's own markets; **VIT price appears nowhere in W** — including, after the §4.3 E-component fix, in the C pillar (B-10 closed). Raw tx count, unadjusted TVL, and VIT price remain excluded from binding W.

### 4.2 The C split: `C_onchain` vs `C_attested` (B-9, D-18)

The superseded spec claimed daily gate-breach flags were "deterministic, no oracle discretion" while feeding C from attested components with challenge windows — a contradiction. C is now **split**:

- **`C_onchain`** — components that are deterministic and same-block computable from runtime state. **Only `C_onchain` (together with S, which is already fully on-chain/relay-derived) drives the DAILY gate-breach flags and gate-market settlement.** No attested value can move a gate flag, ever.
- **`C_attested`** — components requiring bonded attestation (incidents; any admitted external-price component) via the registries and dispute game of [doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md). These enter **settlement-time W only** (the epoch-end `C_e` used in `W_e` and hence in `s`), after their challenge windows close. A contested `C_attested` component follows the neutral-settlement/VOID rules of doc 07 and never blocks or back-dates a daily flag.

### 4.3 Metric set (restructured pillar table)

Changes vs. the superseded §12.3: XCM health `X` moves from S into `C_onchain` (it is a security/continuity fact, and the gate-driving set must be the deterministic set); new `C_onchain` components `R` (reserve health), `Π` (runtime integrity), `K` (collator-set adequacy); `E` re-based on coverage ratios and moved to `C_onchain` (it is now fully on-chain computable); `H` stays in C as on-chain. S becomes pure liveness: `min(U, F, D_eff)`.

| Pillar | Component (weight `w`) | Formula | Source class | Missing-data rule | Chief gaming vector / note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S** = min(U, F, D_eff) | Block production `U` | authored parachain blocks ÷ scheduled slots per epoch; empty blocks weighted 25% | on-chain | halted chain ⇒ no snapshot ⇒ dead-man §4.8 | collator padding — priced by the 25% weight |
| | Relay inclusion/finality `F` | `1 − clamp(median(relay_parent_gap − target)/Λ_max, 0, 1)` | relay-derived from `PersistedValidationData.relay_parent_number` (the relay best/anchor; `relay_parent_gap` = its advancement across parachain blocks) — verified 2026-07-20 (SQ-282) as the only relay signal on stable2606: the relay **GRANDPA finalized head is not** exposed to the parachain runtime (a relay client-level property, absent from relay runtime storage / validation data / the relay state proof), so `F` is an inclusion/liveness measure, not a GRANDPA-finality one | carry-last-valid + flag | hard to fake upward |
| | Collator concentration `D_eff` | phase-capped, §4.5 | on-chain | — | key-splitting — invulnerable-era value pinned to registry entities |
| **C_onchain** (weighted geo, §4.4) | XCM health `X` (0.25) | v1 (local counters only, [09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md) §6.4, SQ-113): locally-accepted sends ÷ (accepted + local send failures + reserve-probe timeouts) over the window — remote delivery/execution outcomes are not runtime-readable on stable2606 (XCM v5, re-checked at the D-19 line move), so X is partial by construction and the R fail-static fallback carries the flag | on-chain counters | no traffic ⇒ 1 (absence of failure) | self-sent failing XCM costs fees; alarms ops |
| | Reserve health `R` (0.25) | fail-static flag ∈ {0, 1}: 0 while a reserve-anomaly trigger is active (Asset Hub channel down past threshold, or sovereign-reserve reconciliation mismatch / PB-RESERVE armed — [doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md)/[08](./08-treasury-and-economics.md)); else 1 | on-chain trigger | trigger state is the value (fail-static) | closes the USDC-freeze blindness gap (B-med) |
| | Economic security `E` (0.20) | coverage ratios, §4.3.1 — **dimensionless, no price input** | on-chain | — | bond-asset pump is inert: no price enters (B-10) |
| | Weight headroom `H` (0.15) | `1 − mean(block weight used ÷ limit)`, mapped so 40% target utilization ⇒ 1 | on-chain | — | spam lowers H and costs fees (self-defeating) |
| | Runtime integrity `Π` (0.10) | `max(0, 1 − 0.25 · defensive_failure_events)` per window, from the runtime's defensive-path/integrity counter (`try-state`-adjacent alarms recorded on-chain) | on-chain counter | no events ⇒ 1 | — |
| | Collator-set adequacy `K` (0.05) | `min(1, distinct_active_authors / collator.n_min)` *(collator.n_min: §13, default 4)* | on-chain | — | — |
| **C_attested** (§4.4) | Incident score `I` (multiplier) | `max(0, 1 − Σ severity)`; S1 = 1.0, S2 = 0.4, S3 = 0.1; bonded filings + challenge in `pallet-registry` ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md)) | attested | no filings ⇒ 1 | suppression — permissionless bonded filing, slash for wrong rejection |
| | External-price components (admissible class; **none registered in v1**) | per registered MetricSpec via doc 07's registries | attested | per spec | value-scaled bonds (doc 07) |
| **P** (weighted geo) | Fees burned/paid (0.45) | `N(log1p(fees_USDC))`, protocol fee sink | on-chain | carry + flag | costs exactly the fees |
| | Economically qualified users (0.35) | accounts paying ≥ dust-indexed fee on ≥ 3 distinct days, HLL-estimated, cost-weighted | on-chain sketch | carry + flag | Sybils must pay repeatedly; weight-capped |
| | Settled value (0.20) | fee-weighted transfer value, self-transfer down-weighted | on-chain | carry + flag | wash routing — fee weighting prices it |
| **A** (weighted geo) | Shipped audited upgrades (0.40) | `min(1, milestone points ÷ target)`, attested MilestoneRegistry ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md) §7 — `target` is a frozen per-MetricSpec field, never a [13](./13-parameters.md) key) | attested | 0 if none | scope inflation — enumerated scope classes, challengeable |
| | Runtime performance (0.30) | benchmarked weight-per-op regression index, full-epoch continuous sampling | attested reproducible harness | carry | benchmark-day gaming — continuous sampling |
| | Ecosystem integrations (0.30) | qualified independent integrations passing a 30-day on-chain fee-paying usage bar | attested registry | 0 | shells — usage bar on-chain-verifiable |

**Canonical v1 `MetricId` assignments (added 2026-07-17, SQ-113).** The registered `MetricSpec` set assigns component ids; the v1 assignments are frozen here so runtime bindings, the oracle's per-component games and the FE agree without discovery (new components append, ids are never reused): `C_onchain` — `X` = 1, `R` = 2, `E` = 3, `H` = 4, `Π` = 5, `K` = 6; `S` — `U` = 10, `F` = 11, `D_eff` = 12; `P` — fees = 20, qualified users = 21, settled value = 22; `A` — shipped upgrades = 30, runtime performance = 31, ecosystem integrations = 32. Code mirror: `futarchy_primitives::metric_ids`.

#### 4.3.1 `E` — coverage ratios, no VIT price anywhere (B-10, D-18)

The superseded `E` valued VIT-denominated bonds through an attested VIT price — precisely the VIT → C → W → settlement reflexivity loop the kernel forbids, plus a 30-day-median pump vector into gate flags. Normative replacement:

```
E = Π_j max(cov_j, ε_C)^{v_j},    Σ v_j = 1,   ε_C = 0.01
cov_j = clamp(held_j / required_j, 0, 1)        // same-asset ratio, dimensionless
j ∈ { collator: Σ collator bonds held (VIT) / (collator.bond_req_vit · n_target),
      guardian: Σ guardian bonds held (VIT) / (grd.bond · 7),
      oracle:   Σ reporter stakes held (USDC) / (orc.reporter_stake · orc.n_min) }
Default v = (0.4, 0.3, 0.3)   (normative values incl. *_req keys: §13)
```

Every ratio divides a held amount by a **requirement denominated in the same asset** (VIT requirements in VIT, USDC requirements in USDC — requirements are constitution keys). No conversion rate, no external price, no oracle input exists in `E`; it is deterministic and same-block computable, hence lives in `C_onchain`. Raising security by raising requirements is a values/META decision on the `*_req` keys, not a market observable.

### 4.4 Intra-pillar aggregation — fully specified (B-med: C/P/A aggregation; G-7)

Two conforming implementations MUST compute bit-identical `FixedU64` pillar values, `W_e` and `s`. The formulas, weights, ε-floors, **and the evaluation order and rounding** are all normative.

```
S_e      = min(U, F, D_eff)                                   // unchanged: min, no weights
C_e      = I_e · Π_{j ∈ C_onchain} max(c_j, ε_C)^{w_j}        // settlement-time C: incident-multiplied
           · Π_{j ∈ C_attested \ {I}} max(c_j, ε_C)^{w_j}     // (external-price class; empty in v1)
C_daily  = Π_{j ∈ C_onchain} max(c_j^{day}, ε_C)^{w_j / Σ_onchain w}   // weights renormalized over the
                                                              // on-chain subset; NO attested term, ever
S_daily  = min(U^{day}, F^{day}, D_eff^{day})
P_e      = Π_i max(p_i, ε_P)^{w_i}          A_e = Π_i max(a_i, ε_P)^{w_i}
ε_C = ε_P = 0.01 (K);  all weight vectors sum to 1 exactly (checked at spec registration)
```

`I` is a pure multiplier (no weight, no ε-floor): an S1 incident zeroes `C_e`, which the g-gate turns into `W_e = 0` — the incident-multiplied semantics of the source, preserved deliberately.

**Weights live in the MetricSpec.** The `MetricSpec` record gains normative fields: `pillar ∈ {S, C_onchain, C_attested, P, A}`, `weight: FixedU64`, `epsilon_floor: FixedU64`, and — for a milestone component of the A pillar — `target` (the divisor of §4.3's `min(1, points ÷ target)`, frozen per version so a live cohort's milestones can never be retroactively renormalized; [07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md) §7), alongside the existing `{ id, formula_ref, units, repr, source class, cadence, normalization rule, sanity bounds, missing-data rule, gaming vectors + min-cost estimate, challenge procedure, version, activation_epoch ≥ current + 2, in-flight rule }`. Registering a spec whose pillar weights do not sum to 1, missing the gaming-vector section, or declaring a milestone component with no positive `target`, MUST be rejected. Open cohorts always settle on their creation-time spec version, weights included (I-16). **Activation is implicit and scheduled, not a second transaction (normative; SQ-80):** registering a spec version *is* the activation decision — it stores an immutable `activation_epoch` that makes the version **eligible** at that epoch, with no further call. There is no pending/active state pair and no `welfare.activate_spec`; the two-call surface formerly in [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §2.1/§3.2 is struck. The reason is liveness: a two-phase model creates a registered-but-never-activated limbo that one missed governance step can leave permanently pending, whereas a stored future epoch cannot fail to arrive. At each epoch the **active** version is the *unique* registered version with the latest fully-live `activation_epoch`; registration does not forbid two versions sharing an `activation_epoch`, and if several tie then **no version is active** — the fail-closed direction. Eligibility is therefore scheduled, activeness is resolved per epoch, and the two MUST NOT be conflated. At genesis the lead is one epoch (activation at epoch 1) because epoch 0 is the pre-launch sentinel; post-genesis the `≥ current + 2` lead applies.

**Determinism discipline (normative):**
1. All component values are `FixedU64` (1e9) in [0,1] before aggregation.
2. Weighted geometric terms are evaluated in **ascending `MetricId` order** as `y = exp2(Σ w_i · log2(max(x_i, ε)))` in the 64.64 `futarchy-fixed` representation ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md) §fixed-point); each `w_i · log2(·)` product is rounded toward −∞ at 64.64 before summation.
3. Every multiplication in `g(·)` (evaluated as `t·t·(3 − 2t)`) and in the `W_e` product `g(S)·g(C)·GeoComposite` rounds **down** to the 1e9 grid immediately.
4. Final `W_e` is clamped to [0,1]. `s = exp2((log2 max(W_{e+1}, ε_W) + log2 max(W_{e+2}, ε_W)) / 2)` with `ε_W = 1e−9` (one base unit; keeps the log finite for a zeroed epoch), rounded down to `FixedU64`.
5. Conformance vectors for the full pipeline (raw counters → components → pillars → W → s) are published and CI-regenerated per [doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md).

### 4.5 Launch collator-D cap — phase schedule (D-15, B-med: collator-D cap)

`D = (1 − HHI(blocks by collator)) / (1 − 1/n_ref)` with `n_ref = 8` reads 0.914 for a healthy 5-collator launch set, dragging `g(S)` to ≈ 0.08 and making Phase-3 calibration exit criteria unmeetable. Normative fix — the normalization target is **phase-scheduled**:

```
D_eff = min(1, (1 − HHI) / (1 − 1/n_cap(phase)))
```

| Rollout phase ([doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)) | `n_cap` |
|---|---|
| Phases 0–3 (bootstrap, shadow, real-USDC under sudo) | 5 |
| Phase 4 | 6 |
| Phase 5 | 7 |
| Phases 6+ | 8 (= n_ref; cap inactive) |

`n_cap` is monotone non-decreasing, steps only at phase-gate advancement, and is a phase-keyed constant (not PARAM-reachable). Cohorts in flight keep their creation-time `n_cap` (I-16 discipline). The cap neutralizes only the *set-size* penalty: a 5-collator set with equal authorship scores `D_eff = 1.0`, while genuine concentration is still punished (e.g. authorship 40/40/10/5/5% ⇒ HHI = 0.335 ⇒ `D_eff = 0.831` at `n_cap = 5`).

### 4.6 Normalization and cold start (B-15, D-15)

**Active MetricSpec selector (normative).** For a queried epoch, the active MetricSpec is the unique version with the latest activation epoch among versions whose complete component set is active at that epoch. No qualifying version, or a tie at the latest activation epoch, means that no MetricSpec is active. The qualification path and `welfare_current` MUST use this same selector; neither surface may independently choose or infer a version.

Steady state (unchanged): each raw metric is winsorized at the 5th/95th percentile of the trailing **12 finalized epoch values**, `log1p` for heavy-tailed series, min–max mapped to [0,1]; normalization constants for epoch e are computed from Snapshot(e−1) history and **frozen at epoch open before any epoch-e market opens**. **Percentile family (normative):** inclusive linear interpolation (the "type-7" estimator — rank `1 + f·(n−1)` on the ascending sample, linearly interpolated between the bracketing order statistics); on-chain it is evaluated on the `FixedU64` 1e9 grid with the interpolation product rounded **down**, per §4.4's discipline. With the always-12-element §4.6 sample this is never vacuous: p5 interpolates between x₁ and x₂, p95 between x₁₁ and x₁₂ (nearest-rank would degenerate to min/max here, which is not meant).

**Cold start (epochs 1–12).** Genesis ships, per normalized component:

```
PriorBounds: map MetricId → BoundedVec<FixedU64, 12>   // 12 pseudo-observations per component,
                                                        // declared from Phase-2 shadow-run data
```

For epoch e with `n = min(e − 1, 12)` finalized epochs available, the winsorization sample is the **most recent 12 elements of the sequence `PriorBounds[id] ++ finalized values`** — i.e., real values displace pseudo-observations oldest-first (`prior ∪ available`, trailing-12). The p5/p95 winsorization bounds and min–max constants are computed from that 12-element sample exactly as in steady state. Consequences: `s` is deterministically computable **from epoch 1**; at epoch 13 the sample is fully real and the rule reduces to the steady-state rule with no discontinuity in mechanism. `PriorBounds` is immutable post-genesis; correcting a bad prior is a new MetricSpec version via the `metric` track (activation ≥ 2 epochs out; in-flight cohorts unaffected, I-16). The declared pseudo-observations and the shadow-run evidence behind them MUST be published with genesis artifacts ([doc 15](./15-invariants-and-testing.md)).

### 4.7 Daily gate-breach flags (deterministic; gates acting twice)

Each epoch day, `S_daily` and `C_daily` (§4.4 — **on-chain components only**) are computed from that day's counters. The flag for gate g is set iff the day value is below θ_g⁻. Storage: `GateBreachFlags: map EpochId → { s_breached: bool, c_breached: bool, day_bitmap: [u32; 2] }`. These flags — and nothing else — settle the gate markets ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)) and arm the guardian `suspend_on_gate` power ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)). Ex post, gates inside `W_e` (which *does* include `C_attested` at settlement time) zero realized welfare on breach. Attested data can therefore lower a cohort's settlement `s`, but can never flip a gate flag or a gate-market settlement (B-9 closed).

**Recording cardinality (normative).** `record_daily_gate` is **repeat-tolerant** by construction: flags are OR-merged, so re-recording an already-recorded `(epoch, day, spec_version)` with identical components is a *state* no-op and MUST NOT be rejected — late and duplicate submissions from independent keepers ([01](./01-system-overview.md) §4.2) are the expected operating mode, and rejecting them would turn a benign race into a failed dispatch the losing keeper must special-case. Rebate eligibility is nevertheless **state-change-gated** ([08](./08-treasury-and-economics.md) §6.3): only a recording that samples a previously unsampled day or sets a new breach flag draws on the general tranche, so duplicates cannot drain the keeper meter. Sample tracking MUST use storage distinct from the breach `day_bitmap` above, which remains a breached-days-only map.

### 4.8 Dead-man switch (carried forward)

If the relay best advances **≥ 4,800 relay blocks without the parachain anchoring a new block** (~8 h — the §4.3 `relay_parent_gap`, seen as a relay-parent jump on catch-up: a relay-liveness or parachain block-production/inclusion stall) or a snapshot is **> 4 days overdue**: the execution queue freezes, open decision windows extend day-for-day, the epoch clock pauses; recovery runs one proposal-free epoch. The enumerated coretime-renewal call is exempt (D-9, [doc 09](./09-execution-upgrades-and-rollout.md)).

**The recovery epoch (normative; SQ-90 resolution, 2026-07-20).** Recovery is one **proposal-free** epoch, and "proposal-free" is enforced by refusing the proposal-advancing entry points for its duration: `submit`, `qualify`, `open_markets`, `decide`, rerun-open (T13) and `settle_cohort` all fail with a phase error while a recovery epoch is set. Execution callbacks (`mark_executed`, `mark_failed_executed`, retry exhaustion, `veto_upheld`) and guardian transitions (`delay_once`, `force_rerun`, `schedule_rerun`, vault voiding) are **not** blocked — they resolve to the status quo or release funds, so blocking them would work against G-1. Mandate expiry is blocked only in its *automatic* form: the keeper's bounded `tick` sweep is a no-op for the recovery epoch's duration, while the dedicated `expire_or_stale_queue` entry point (Keeper or ExecutionGuard origin) stays callable, so a `Queued` mandate can still be expired or stale-rejected on demand. **Withdrawal is closed for the whole recovery epoch**: `withdraw` legally requires `proposal.epoch == CurrentEpoch`, recovery is a *fresh* epoch index (resume increments the clock, so recovery = pause epoch + 1) and `submit` is refused throughout it, so no proposal can satisfy that guard. This is a bounded deferral rather than a forfeiture — the intake bond stays held and withdrawal reopens as soon as carry-forward re-anchors the proposal on the roll that ends recovery. **This deferral is deliberate, not incidental (SQ-285 resolution, 2026-07-20).** G-1 constrains what the protocol *does* on a failure path, and declining to process an exit is inaction: no bond is forfeited, no claim is created, and the proposer's position is preserved exactly. Relaxing the guard would be the *active* choice — it would release funds and mutate intake bookkeeping while the epoch clock is paused and carry-forward re-anchoring is mid-flight, i.e. more state movement during an incident, not less. The recovery epoch is one epoch long by construction, so the deferral is bounded by the same clock the dead-man already governs. Proposals that were `Submitted` and still in the intake queue when the pause began are **carried forward**: on the epoch roll that ends recovery, their `epoch` field is re-anchored to the epoch the crank observes (a late crank therefore lands them later than recovery + 1 — the carry is defined by the observed clock, not by a fixed target). Deadlines are re-anchored by the pause-duration shift above, not re-derived. "Exactly one" holds absent re-trigger: a fresh trigger arriving mid-recovery re-pauses the clock and restarts the proposal-free epoch.

**Snapshot-overdue trigger under an active pause (normative; SQ-254 resolution, 2026-07-20).** The snapshot deadline is schedule-derived and keeps running while the clock is paused, but `record_snapshot` legally requires `epoch < CurrentEpoch` — so an epoch whose close is itself blocked by the pause can never be cranked. Evaluating the overdue trigger against such an epoch would latch a cause no crank can clear and make recovery unreachable (no origin can clear the flag). The snapshot-overdue trigger is therefore **suppressed for exactly those epochs whose close is blocked by the active pause** — i.e. while the clock is paused *and* the outstanding snapshot's due epoch is at or after the current epoch index. An epoch that had already closed before the pause began is **not** suppressed: it remains genuinely overdue and may re-arm the detector. Trigger 1 (relay-parent gap) is unaffected.

**Straddle semantics on resume (normative; SQ-255 resolution, 2026-07-20).** "Open decision windows extend day-for-day" binds the *registered market decision window*, not merely the proposal's `decide_at`. On resume the pause duration is added to `decide_at` for `Trading | Extended` proposals and to `maturity`/`grace_end` for `Queued | Suspended | FailedExecuted` ones, and each affected proposal's already-registered market window is **extended in place to the shifted boundary** (its end is moved; the window is not re-registered, and a window already sealed is refused). Without that extension the shifted boundary would fall outside the registered window and sealing would wedge. This is consistent with §5.4 step 2: while the switch is *engaged*, `decide()` resolves in-flight proposals to `Reject(ProcessHold)` — the extension governs windows that survive to a post-resume decision, not proposals decided during engagement.

**Observability (verified 2026-07-20, SQ-282).** Both triggers are on-chain-observable from the parachain runtime: trigger 1 from the `PersistedValidationData.relay_parent_number` advancement (§4.3 `F`), trigger 2 from the snapshot cadence. The relay's GRANDPA *finalized* head is **not** exposed to the parachain runtime on stable2606 (a relay client-level property, absent from relay runtime storage, the validation data, and the relay state proof), so a pure relay *finality* stall — the relay best keeps advancing and the parachain keeps building on the unfinalized best — is not detectable in-band. Its blast radius is bounded by XCM isolation (I-24: no XCM outcome enters a decision or settlement path) and the relay's own GRANDPA finality-gadget security; the detection layer for it is an **off-chain relay best-over-finalized monitor** — an ops obligation ([12](./12-release-and-operations.md) §6.3) not yet in the alert set (the existing keeper tick-lag alert reads the *parachain* finalized head and does not observe a relay finality stall; SQ-283). The dead-man detects the block-production/inclusion-stall and snapshot-liveness cases the parachain *can* see.

## 5. Decision engine

### 5.1 Gate-veto tests (kernel-ordered, carried forward)

For every market-bearing class (`PARAM | TREASURY | CODE | META`), four binary gate books per proposal trade the question "conditional on ADOPT (resp. REJECT), will the S (resp. C) daily floor-breach flag be set on ≥ 1 day during epochs e+1…e+2?" (book mechanics: [doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md); settlement source: §4.7). For PARAM these are the same deterministic system-wide breach facts as for the other classes: `S_gate(pid, branch) = ∃ day ∈ epochs e+1…e+2: S_daily(day) < θS⁻`, and analogously for `C_gate`; this is a correlated-harm proxy, not causal attribution to the parameter delta.

```
veto  iff  p̂ᵍ_adopt > p_max(g)              // absolute ruin cap (default 0.05, kernel ceiling 0.10)
       or  p̂ᵍ_adopt > p̂ᵍ_reject + ε(g)      // relative test (default 0.02)
       for either g ∈ {S, C}
```

No welfare margin overrides a veto (G-4, I-14). No market-bearing class is exempt through static classification.

### 5.2 Sanity band and per-book validity (B-med: sanity band)

- **Welfare books** (the decision pair and the Baseline book): decision-grade requires `TWAP ∈ [0.02, 0.98]` (the sanity band), plus coverage ≥ 95% of scheduled observation intervals in the window, staleness clean, time-averaged effective POL ≥ class floor and POL undisturbed, non-POL **contest capital** ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md) §7a — the time-weighted marked value of net outstanding trader positions; gross traded notional is *not* the measure, SQ-231 amendment 2026-07-18) ≥ **`dec.v_min(class)` per book** (the per-book resolution of the V_min ambiguity — each of the two decision books MUST individually clear it), and `|spot_close − TWAP| ≤ Δ_max = 0.05`. The **Baseline book carries no proposal class and grades at the TREASURY-tier floor `dec.v_min.trs`** — [doc 08](./08-treasury-and-economics.md) §4.3's mid-class manipulation-resistance rationale is the source of the tier, and the same tier already sizes its `pol.b_baseline` subsidy (SQ-232 resolution, 2026-07-18).
- **Gate books are exempt from the sanity band** — a healthy gated proposal's gate books legitimately trade near 0. They instead satisfy the **near-boundary validity rule (GB-NB)**: a gate book whose window TWAP lies outside [0.02, 0.98] is decision-grade iff coverage ≥ 98%, zero stale events, and `|spot_close − TWAP| ≤ 0.01` *(keys `gate.nb_coverage`, `gate.nb_conv`: §13)* — a book pinned near a boundary counts only if it is demonstrably alive and converged, not abandoned. Inside the band, gate books use the welfare-book validity checks. For **every market-bearing class**, gate books' contest floor is the **live** `gate.v_min(class)` per book *(normative value: [13](13-parameters.md) §1)* — `0.1 · dec.v_min(class)` is its seeded default, not a standing identity: the key is independently amendable within the coupling band `[×0.05, ×0.5]` of `dec.v_min(class)` that [13](13-parameters.md) reading rule 7 owns and enforces at the amendment boundary (clarified 2026-07-20, SQ-194 — the previous equality wording contradicted the amendable key it was describing). Grading uses the same contest-capital measure.

### 5.3 Baseline consumption (backed by doc 04)

The reject-leg floor consumes the epoch's Baseline welfare market — now a fully specified instrument with a ledger home, `pol.b_baseline` subsidy, `BaselineMarketOf: map EpochIndex → MarketId` discoverability, and a settlement path ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md), [doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md), B-3/X-10):

```
r_eff = max(r_f, base − σ(class))        // base = decision-window TWAP of BaselineMarketOf(p.epoch)
```

If the Baseline book fails decision-grade for the window, `base` carries the **previous epoch's settled Baseline decision-window TWAP** with the decision flagged (`BaselineCarried` event); two consecutive carried epochs force `Reject(NotDecisionGrade)` for every gate-bearing class. Rationale: silently dropping the floor would reward Baseline-book suppression (threat row: [doc 14](./14-threat-model.md)); bricking all decisions on one dead book is disproportionate for one epoch.

### 5.4 Ordered checks (normative; executable-quality pseudocode)

The 10-step rule is carried forward and becomes **11 steps**: step 9 (security sizing, D-4) is new; step 10 adds the attestation-presence check (D-5/D-18); the `Emergency::restricted` hold is deleted (D-7); the extension match now produces `SecondExtensionFailed` (previously unreachable).

TWAPs are the slew-capped accumulator means of [doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md); a single block cannot move them by more than κ (I-13). `Extend` fires at most once per proposal across all causes (insufficiency, disagreement, first stale event — one shared budget, T8). A second insufficiency or disagreement always rejects — never a noisy PASS. PARAM MAY resubmit after 14 days; CODE/META must resubmit fresh. Close-randomization remains disabled in v1 (no verified bias-resistant parachain randomness).

**The `δ + 1 pp` rerun regime: one producer field, one consuming window (normative; SQ-188 resolution, 2026-07-20).** Both rerun kinds set the *same* durable flag — `Proposal.rerun` (§1.2) — and it is the sole input to the increment: step 7 reads it as `DELTA[p.class] + if p.rerun { ONE_PP }`. The keeper's T13 rerun-open (`Rerun → Extended`, after `delay_once` schedules it) and the guardian's `force_rerun` (**T25**; [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §5.3, which goes `Trading`/`Extended`/`Queued → Extended` directly and never passes through the `Rerun` state) both set `rerun := true`, so the guardian path is **not** a second, unflagged regime. Uniqueness is enforced on the producer side, not the consumer: `force_rerun` is admissible only while `!rerun && !delayed_once`, which is the code-level form of 06 §5.3's "at most one guardian rerun of either kind per proposal, ever". The window that consumes the increment is the rerun's **own** Extended window and only that one: each producer sets `decide_at := now + dec.extension` and `extended := true` in the same transition, so exactly one `decide()` runs under the raised hurdle and no further extension is admissible (step 6 requires `!p.extended`). A rerun therefore cannot leak its raised hurdle into a later window, and a non-rerun proposal cannot inherit one.

### 5.6 Security sizing: `InCapPrize ≤ AttackCost̂ / 3` (D-4, B-8 engine side)

The capture-resistance rule `AttackCost ≥ 3 · MEV` is now enforced *per decision, from measured depth* — it scales with the value at stake by construction. The **normative runtime estimator is doc 08 §5.2's flow-model form** (it is the review's own B-8 methodology, and the `v_min = 2·P` identity of doc 08 §5.3 guarantees it is satisfiable exactly when a proposal attracts organic depth proportional to its prize). The engine evaluates, in 64.64 math with `AttackCost̂` rounded DOWN and `InCapPrize` rounded UP (every approximation error makes the check *harder* to pass):

```
AttackCost̂ = F̂ · T_dec                          // normative gate input (doc 08 §5.2)
  T_dec = dec.window / 14,400 blocks-per-day     // = 3 days at default
  F̂     = min( L̂/2, F̂_pub ) per day             // conservative minimum
  L̂     = time-averaged effective POL depth of the decision pair (2·b·ln 2 as seeded,
          from I-12 telemetry)
        + min( min(ContestCapital_acc(window), ContestCapital_rej(window))
               (doc 04 §7a — the binding shallower book; the same per-book measure
                graded against dec.v_min in step 5; SQ-231: gross flow no longer
                feeds the certificate; doc 08 §5.4(b) adds one dec.v_min, not two),
               sec.flow_cap · (b_acc + b_rej) )   // the C_hold ceiling, now also in the gate
  F̂_pub = the published measured arbitrage-flow parameter (A-2 obligation);
          until published, F̂ = L̂/2

InCapPrize = match class {                       // doc 08 §5.2's table governs
    Treasury       => p.ask,                                    // committed USDC outflow
    Param          => certified capability-envelope value,      // floored at sec.prize.param
    Code | Meta    => max(p.ask, envelope value),               // floored at trs.cap_proposal ·
                                                                //   spendable-NAV for upgrade payloads;
                                                                //   sec.prize.{code,meta} are kernel floors
    Constitutional => unreachable (no markets),
}
```

**Rule (step 9):** `3 · InCapPrize ≤ AttackCost̂`, else `Reject(SecuritySizing)`. SF = 3 is a kernel floor (K). A proposal whose prize proxy is undefined MUST NOT pass (conservative default).

**Mandatory diagnostic — `ManipFloor̂` (not a gate in v1).** `AttackCost̂` above is an *upper bound* on manipulation bleed (doc 08 §5.5). The engine additionally computes and emits, per decision, the finer *lower-bound* estimate

```
ManipFloor̂ = C_disp + C_hold                     // emitted in DecisionDiagnostics, never gates in v1

C_disp = Σ_{book ∈ {acc, rej}} b_book · ln( ((p̄ + δc)·(1 − p̄)) / ((1 − p̄ − δc)·p̄) )
         // closed-form LMSR cost of displacing each decision book's window TWAP p̄ by
         // δc = DELTA[class] (+1 pp if rerun), inputs clamped to the quoting domain (doc 04)

C_hold = min(V_win, sec.flow_cap · (b_acc + b_rej)) · δc
         // adverse-selection bleed of holding a δc mispricing against the window's
         // contest capital: since the SQ-231 amendment V_win *is* that measure
         // (doc 04 §7a), so churn and wash flow net out by construction rather than
         // being merely capped; sec.flow_cap remains as the secondary ceiling (doc 14)
```

`ManipFloor̂` is part of the Phase 3–4 measurement obligation alongside `F̂` (doc 08 §5.5): if published `ManipFloor̂` persistently reads below `3 · InCapPrize` for adopted proposals, the values layer MUST tighten δ and/or the `dec.v_min`/`pol.b` slopes before caps rise — the diagnostic exists precisely because the flow-model gate is an upper bound. The Phase-0 exit simulation ([15](15-invariants-and-testing.md) §4.9) validates this envelope at the irreducible economic line: it flags a causal wrong-PASS flip as a security failure only when the *realized* attacker cost falls **below the prize** (a profitable capture); an unprofitable flip whose realized cost is ≥ the prize but below `3 · InCapPrize` is deep-pocket griefing (TM-18) that the SF = 3 margin conservatively guards against — recorded as a diagnostic, not a Phase-0 gate failure. Economic derivation, calibration, the worked recomputation at defaults, and the secondary Ask-scaled liquidity mechanism (`pol.b`, `dec.v_min`, δ scaling with `ask`, floors = current defaults) live in [doc 08](./08-treasury-and-economics.md).

## 6. SettleAuthority wiring — one path (B-med: SettleAuthority)

The superseded spec both assigned `SettleAuthority` to "pallet-welfare/oracle" and had `pallet-epoch::settle_cohort` drive settlement — contradicting the one-origin-per-path rule. Normative resolution — **exactly one path**, entered only from `pallet-epoch`:

```
pallet-epoch::settle_cohort(e, batch)                       [Signed keeper; cursor-resumable]
  └─ for each proposal in cohort e, and for Baseline(e):
       pallet-welfare::compute_settlement(pid | baseline e)  [callable ONLY from pallet-epoch]
         ├─ computes s = GeoMean(W_{e+1}, W_{e+2}) on the creation-time MetricSpec (I-16, §4.4)
         ├─ reads GateBreachFlags(e+1, e+2) for gate outcomes (§4.7)
         └─ dispatches with pallet-welfare's SettleAuthority origin:
              ledger.settle_scalar(pid, s)                   (doc 03)
              ledger.settle_gate(pid, gate, outcome)         (doc 03, B-2 instruments)
              ledger.settle_baseline(e, s)                   (doc 03, BaselineVaults, B-3)

pallet-epoch::finalize_epoch_baseline(e)                    [Signed, permissionless; §7(6)]
  └─ Baseline(e) only, and only for an orphan epoch (§7(6) preconditions):
       pallet-welfare::compute_settlement(baseline e, neutral)
         └─ dispatches with pallet-welfare's SettleAuthority origin:
              ledger.settle_baseline(e, 0.5)                 (spec-fixed constant; no score computed)
```

**Two triggers, one authority (normative; SQ-320).** `compute_settlement` is reachable from **exactly two** `pallet-epoch` entry points and from nowhere else: `settle_cohort` (the measured path) and `finalize_epoch_baseline` (the orphan-epoch neutral path of §7(6)). Both dispatch under the same single `SettleAuthority` origin owned by `pallet-welfare`, so the one-origin-per-path rule is unchanged — §7(6) adds a second *trigger*, never a second authority. The orphan path computes no score: it carries the spec-fixed `s = 0.5`, so it reads no snapshot, no MetricSpec and no gate flags, and it can settle **only** a Baseline vault — never a proposal vault and never a gate.

Authority-table fragment (full table: [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)):

| Ledger call | Origin | Sole producer |
|---|---|---|
| `resolve(pid, branch)` | `ResolveAuthority` = pallet-epoch | T17/T21/T22 transition handlers (§2.1) |
| `void(pid)` | `ResolveAuthority` = pallet-epoch | T20 / PB-ORACLE-VOID path ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md)) |
| `settle_scalar(pid, s)` | `SettleAuthority` = **pallet-welfare only** | `compute_settlement`, itself reachable only via `pallet-epoch::settle_cohort` |
| `settle_gate(pid, gate, outcome)` | `SettleAuthority` = pallet-welfare only | same path |
| `settle_baseline(epoch, s)` | `SettleAuthority` = pallet-welfare only | `compute_settlement`, reachable via `pallet-epoch::settle_cohort` (measured `s`) **or** `pallet-epoch::finalize_epoch_baseline` (neutral `s = 0.5`, §7(6)) |

No other pallet, origin, playbook, or values track can invoke any settlement call. Oracle outcomes influence settlement exclusively through the components `pallet-welfare` reads (with challenge windows closed — I-18); `pallet-oracle` holds no ledger authority.

## 7. Cohort settlement semantics

1. **Timing.** Cohort e settles at e+3 Housekeeping (frozen constant), after Snapshot(e+2) finalizes and every consumed attested component's challenge window has closed ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md)). Any component not challenge-closed by its **`OracleSettleDeadline`** — the start of the consuming epoch's Housekeeping, d20 ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md) §11; consolidated in [doc 13](./13-parameters.md) §2) — settles neutrally, so cohort settlement always proceeds in its scheduled Housekeeping and never waits on a live dispute.
2. **Score.** One `s` per cohort epoch, per §4.4(4), on each proposal's creation-time MetricSpec. Realized-branch scalar books settle at `s`; gate books settle on the §4.7 flags; the Baseline book settles at the same `s` ([doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md)).
3. **Branch semantics.** Executed and executed-with-failure proposals (T17, T22/T23) measure the ACCEPT branch; rejected/expired proposals (T21) measure the REJECT branch. Both settle against the *same* realized `s` — the score measures the world, the branch records which counterfactual was realized.
4. **Failure interplay.** Neutral settlement (component carry + renormalization) and VOID (vault `Voided`, par recovery per D-1) follow doc 07/doc 03; VOIDed cohorts skip this section entirely (`CohortInfo.status = Void`, T20) — "this section" being **welfare scoring**: a voided cohort computes no `s`, so no proposal book settles on one, and its proposal vaults reach `Voided` instead.

**Cohort-VOID proposal disposition (normative; reconciled with §2.1 — SQ-314).** The cohort-VOID path partitions the epoch's affected proposals by **cohort membership** and treats the two populations differently:

- **The cohort's own members** — by construction exactly those proposals that reached `Measuring`, since entering measurement is the only way a proposal joins `CohortInfo.proposals` — MUST retain their recorded state and their recorded `DecisionOutcome` unchanged, and MUST NOT emit `ProposalForceRejected`. They take the cohort/vault treatment only: any market-backed vault moves to `Voided` ([doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §2.3) and the cohort carries the `CohortVoided` outcome. They are archived with the decision the market actually produced.
- **Every other affected proposal** — the epoch's non-terminal pre-Executed proposals — takes T20: the path MUST terminally archive it with state `Rejected(ProcessHold)` and `DecisionOutcome::Reject(ProcessHold)`, MUST emit `ProposalForceRejected`, and MUST move any market-backed vault to `Voided`.

Any queued execution is cancelled in the same transaction for **both** populations (I-15), and both leave the non-terminal working set in that transaction. The split is mandatory rather than cosmetic: the cohort archive is the only durable record of what the market concluded, so overwriting a completed `Adopt` with `Reject(ProcessHold)` would record a rejection the market never produced ([doc 07](./07-oracle-and-disputes.md) §10: "decisions already made stand"). An earlier revision of this paragraph required the overwrite for *every* affected proposal, contradicting §2.1's normative note; §2.1 and doc 07 govern, and this paragraph is now stated to agree with them.

Membership, **not** the mere presence of a recorded outcome, is the discriminator: T9 records `Some(Adopt)` on entry to `Queued`, so a decided-but-pre-Executed proposal (`Queued`, `Suspended`, `Rerun`, `FailedExecuted`) carries an outcome the market reached but never saw executed or measured. Those proposals take T20, which is the conservative reading — it changes nothing but the `Measuring` case SQ-314 named. Whether T20's `Reject(ProcessHold)` is the *truthful* archive record for that population, given that a real `Adopt` is thereby overwritten, is deliberately left open as **SQ-319**.

5. **The one settlement a VOID still performs.** Skipping the score does **not** skip the epoch's **Baseline** vault. Per [doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §2.3/§5 the void path settles it at the fixed neutral `s = 0.5` under the same SettleAuthority, in the same transaction that voids the cohort. This is a terminal transition carrying a spec-fixed constant, not a computation — which is exactly why it survives a VOID, where no measurement is trustworthy. It is **mandatory, not optional**: `BaselineState` has no `Voided` variant ([doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §6.4) precisely because this settlement always happens, and both Baseline redemption calls require `Settled`. Omitting it leaves the vault `Open` forever and strands every single-sided Baseline holder of the voided epoch, while full-pair holders exit at par via `merge_baseline` and mask the defect from every solvency invariant. Owning transition: the epoch-VOID path (T20 cohort void), **not** T21 and not per-proposal `void(pid)` — per-proposal vault voiding is a different VOID and settles no Baseline, because an individual T20 leaves the epoch's sibling proposals live and its cohort still able to form. This path is **one of exactly two** transitions that settle an epoch Baseline vault neutrally; the other is the orphan-epoch finalization of §7(6) below, which covers the disjoint case in which no cohort ever forms at all.

6. **Orphan-epoch Baseline finalization (normative; SQ-320).** §7(5) settles the Baseline vault of an epoch whose cohort **voided**. An epoch whose cohort **never formed** is a distinct case and needs its own transition. If every market-bearing proposal of epoch `e` leaves the non-terminal working set before any of them reaches `Measuring`, then no `CohortInfo(e)` is ever created and no `CohortSummary(e)` is ever archived, so §7(5) has nothing to fire on and T19 is unreachable. The shortest trigger is a **single guardian force-rejection** (T20) against a one-proposal epoch; the broadest is the `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE` sweep, which force-rejects every live non-terminal proposal at once ([doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §6.3). Neither a ledger freeze nor a stalled clock is *required* to reach the state.

   Left alone, the epoch's Baseline vault stays `Open` forever. It records no terminal block, so neither the [doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §5.4 Baseline sweep (which requires a terminal vault) nor the [doc 04](./04-markets-and-pricing.md) §2 book reap (which requires the terminal-block latch that only `settle_baseline` writes) can ever run — the book and its POL stay un-reapable — and because both Baseline redemption calls require `Settled` ([doc 03](./03-conditional-ledger.md) §5.3) **every single-sided Baseline holder of that epoch is stranded**, while full-pair holders exit at par via `merge_baseline` and mask the defect from every conservation invariant, exactly as in §7(5). Under R-7 the reading that strands a claim is the one that must be excluded.

   Normatively: **`pallet-epoch::finalize_epoch_baseline(epoch)` is a permissionless `Signed` call** — any account, a stranded holder included — that settles epoch `e`'s Baseline vault at the same spec-fixed neutral `s = 0.5`, through the same single SettleAuthority chain of §6, and **only** when all three of the following hold at dispatch:

   1. **The epoch is strictly in the past** (`e <` the current epoch index), so no proposal can still qualify into it.
   2. **No cohort ever formed for it** — no `CohortInfo(e)` exists **and** no `CohortSummary(e)` is archived in `RecentCohortSummaries`. A cohort that formed and voided is §7(5)'s case; a cohort that formed and settled took T19.
   3. **No proposal of epoch `e` is still live** — the bounded non-terminal working set (≤ `MaxLiveProposals`, I-21) holds no proposal with `epoch == e`, so none can still reach `Measuring` and form the cohort after the fact (terminal states: §2.1).

   All three MUST be re-checked at dispatch and the call MUST fail without state change if any of them fails: a premature finalization would settle a Baseline against an epoch whose cohort is still reachable, which is the one way this path could destroy information the market is still producing. The call MUST be **idempotent and no-op-safe** in exactly the shape §7(5) already requires — an epoch with no Baseline vault, and a Baseline vault already `Settled`, are both no-ops returning `Ok` rather than failures (§2.1's keeper-idempotency rule; G-1). That clause is also what makes the path well-defined however the Baseline book is provisioned: an epoch that opens no Baseline book at all is simply a no-op. And it is what keeps condition 2 safe against ring eviction — once `CohortSummary(e)` ages out of the 32-cohort ring, condition 2 admits an epoch that *did* settle normally, but its vault is by then `Settled` or reaped, so the call is a harmless no-op and never a second settlement.

   The call carries **no new event**: the settlement it performs emits the frozen ledger `BaselineSettled { epoch, s }` ([doc 02](./02-integration-contract.md) §6), and there is nothing further to announce. It introduces no storage item, no view type and no `FutarchyApi` method, so it leaves the [doc 02](./02-integration-contract.md) contract surface untouched. Its weight is `O(MaxLiveProposals)` — the working-set scan of condition 3 — against exactly one Baseline vault, so it needs no cursor and no batch bound. It MUST remain callable while `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE` is active, consistent with [doc 06](./06-governance-and-guardians.md) §6.3's exemption of settlement calls from the freeze: the freeze's own T20 sweep is one of the two ways an epoch is orphaned, so a freeze that also blocked the repair would guarantee the stranding it exists to contain.
