# Polkadot Futarchy Parachain
## Implementation-Ready Architecture Specification — Version 1.0 Draft

**Status:** Draft for engineering review, economic simulation, and independent audit scoping.
**Normative language:** RFC 2119 (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY).
**Research cutoff:** Model knowledge through January 2026; Polkadot SDK repository state verified against `raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk` on **2026-07-11**. Claims that could not be verified from primary sources in this run are explicitly labeled **[VERIFY]** and MUST be validated before implementation begins.
**Verified in this run:** existence of release branches `polkadot-stable2412` … `polkadot-stable2606`; umbrella crate `polkadot-sdk = "2603.0.0"` on `polkadot-stable2603`; `frame_system::{authorize_upgrade, apply_authorized_upgrade, authorize_upgrade_without_checks}` dispatchables; presence of `pallet-parameters`, `pallet-referenda`, `pallet-conviction-voting`, `pallet-preimage`, `pallet-scheduler`, `pallet-assets`, `pallet-treasury`, `pallet-utility`, `pallet-proxy`, `pallet-multisig`, `pallet-migrations`, `frame-metadata-hash-extension`, `pallet-safe-mode`, `pallet-tx-pause`, `cumulus-pallet-parachain-system`, cumulus `pallet-collator-selection`; `sp-arithmetic` fixed-point types (`FixedU64/I64/U128/I128`); existence of Zombienet, Chopsticks, and `try-runtime-cli` repositories.

## 1. Executive Architecture Decision

The protocol is delivered as **one application-specific Polkadot parachain** ("the futarchy chain") built with the Polkadot SDK, FRAME and Cumulus, secured by the Polkadot relay chain, pinned to release line **`polkadot-stable2603`** (§Appendix A, Q1). All consensus-critical futarchy logic is implemented as **native Rust FRAME pallets**. No smart-contract environment (Solidity, ink!, PVM, EVM) is part of the trusted computing base.

**Chain topology.** Production on the Polkadot relay via bulk Agile Coretime; public testing on the **Paseo** community testnet **[VERIFY current Paseo onboarding process at implementation time]**. The chain holds a single primary collateral asset **NUM** (Asset-Hub-issued USDC, reserve-based transfer from Polkadot Asset Hub) and a native governance/utility asset **GOV** (the parachain's native balance). Collators are permissioned invulnerables at launch, opening to bonded permissionless collation via cumulus `pallet-collator-selection` from rollout Phase 4.

**Governance model.** A two-layer constitution:

- A **values layer** using `pallet-referenda` + `pallet-conviction-voting` over GOV, with narrowly scoped custom tracks. It controls only: welfare-metric definitions and weights, entrenched floor tightening, constitutional-registry amendments within immutable meta-bounds, guardian election/recall, and ratification of META and runtime-upgrade outcomes. It can never enact operational proposals.
- A **beliefs layer** of conditional prediction markets deciding six proposal classes — PARAM, TREASURY, CODE, META, CONSTITUTIONAL (values-side), EMERGENCY (playbook activation) — through a recurring, pipelined **21-day epoch machine** (§9).
- An **immutable constitutional kernel**: compile-time runtime constants plus a runtime-upgrade attestation regime (§18, §19 of the invariant list) that makes silent removal of entrenched invariants detectable and socially non-executable, while acknowledging that Wasm replacement is technically always possible (§2.3).

**Market model.** Scalar **Mode B** futarchy is the sole binding mechanism in v1: complementary LONG/SHORT claims on the normalized realized welfare score `s ∈ [0,1]`, one conditional pair (ACCEPT-world, REJECT-world) per proposal plus an unconditional per-epoch Baseline market, priced by a treasury-subsidized **LMSR** market maker with worst-case loss `b·ln 2` per book, implemented in deterministic 64.64 fixed point with proven error bounds (§11). Decision statistics use a **slew-capped TWAP accumulator** with full-window and trailing-window tests, a convergence rule, and one bounded extension. **Ex-ante ruin-risk (gate-breach) markets** veto CODE, META and high-impact TREASURY adoptions independently of welfare uplift (§13, §14). Mode A price futarchy is advisory-only in v1.

**Collateral model.** NUM is the sole market collateral, bond currency and settlement unit. Conditional claims live in a purpose-built **conditional ledger pallet** with deterministic `PositionId`s, structurally restricted mint/burn/split/merge/transfer/redeem, and a machine-checked collateral-conservation invariant (§10). GOV is the native balance (values voting, collator bonds, guardian bonds). Ordinary fungibles (NUM and any future assets) live in `pallet-assets` instances.

**Oracle model.** Deterministic runtime-derived metrics are computed on-chain by the welfare pallet from bounded per-block counters. Non-derivable metrics settle through a **bonded optimistic reporting game** with escalating challenge rounds against content-hashed, versioned `MetricSpec`s, a hard settlement-latency cap, neutral settlement (`s = 0.5` / VOID) on irrecoverable failure, and values-layer adjudication only as the terminal factual backstop (§15).

**Execution model.** Passed proposals are exact preimage-committed call batches executed by a custom **execution-guard pallet** via a permissionless `execute()` that re-validates maturity, preimage hash, runtime version, capability limits and live constitutional rate limits at dispatch time, then dispatches with a **narrow class-specific custom origin** — never unrestricted Root (§18). Runtime upgrades use the two-phase `frame_system::authorize_upgrade(code_hash)` → permissionless `apply_authorized_upgrade(code)` path (verified), gated behind the CODE/META process plus values ratification.

**Rollout model.** Eight evidence-gated phases (0–7): reference model and simulation → local nets → public testnet with adversarial bounties → shadow futarchy → binding PARAM → limited TREASURY → CODE/META with guardians → mature self-governance with guardian sunset. `pallet-sudo` is removed by the Phase-3→4 runtime upgrade; no administrator Root remains thereafter (§29, §27).

## 2. Design Goals, Assumptions and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Protocol guarantees (enforced by code)

G-1. **Status-quo default.** Every ambiguity, liveness failure, dispute, liquidity shortfall or guard breach resolves to REJECT/no-op. No rejection or timeout path can execute a payload.
G-2. **Collateral conservation.** Conditional claims are always fully collateralized; no reachable state can create an unbacked claim (Invariants I-1…I-4).
G-3. **Annulment.** Trades in the unrealized branch are economically reverted by the complete-set accounting identity (I-2).
G-4. **Ruin gating.** No expected-welfare margin can override the survival/security gate vetoes for classes that carry them (I-14).
G-5. **Narrow authority.** Every privileged effect flows through an enumerated custom origin produced by an enumerated pallet; utility/proxy/multisig/scheduler/XCM wrappers cannot escalate (I-9…I-11).
G-6. **Bounded automation.** Every hook, queue and loop has a provable upper bound and an overload behavior (I-20…I-22).
G-7. **Deterministic settlement.** Markets settle only under the `MetricSpec` version frozen at their creation; no metric change alters in-flight cohorts (I-16).

### 2.2 Economic and social assumptions (not enforceable by code)

A-1. At least one rational, funded keeper exists (cranks are permissionless and rebated; if none exists, the chain adopts nothing — safe but stagnant).
A-2. Arbitrage capital of roughly `F ≈ L/2` per day flows against sustained mispricing (FGP §9.4's load-bearing empirical parameter; MUST be measured in Phases 3–4 and published as `F̂` before caps rise).
A-3. The values-layer electorate is not majority-captured; its supermajorities and delays make capture slow and visible, not impossible.
A-4. A community that observes an invariant-violating runtime upgrade will refuse to follow it (social-fork assumption). This is acknowledged as a backstop, **not** presented as a substitute for the on-chain safeguards of §18.
A-5. Polkadot relay-chain finality, availability and shared security function within their documented parameters.

### 2.3 The entrenchment honesty clause

A runtime upgrade can technically replace any runtime logic, including "immutable" rules. Entrenchment is therefore made *credible* rather than *absolute* by: (a) compile-time kernel constants whose removal requires a Wasm change; (b) the hash-committed two-phase upgrade path with mandatory metadata-hash verification (`frame-metadata-hash-extension`) and reproducible builds (§18.6); (c) a public **kernel attestation**: every CODE/META proposal must carry an independent attestation hash asserting the candidate Wasm preserves the kernel invariant set, checked as a queue-time precondition (I-19); (d) values-layer ratification for all upgrades; and (e) A-4 as final backstop. This is the Polkadot-native translation of FGP/SGF's "immutable contract" (FGP §3.3; SGF §9.3): what an EVM chain achieves with non-upgradable bytecode, a parachain achieves with process, attestation and verifiability.

### 2.4 Non-goals for v1

N-1. Combinatorial futarchy (interdependent proposals are bundled or serialized; EFP §14, GFP §15.7).
N-2. Arbitrary cross-chain governance execution over XCM (only reserve transfers and enumerated queries; §19).
N-3. On-chain continuous limit-order book (§11.9 records the analysis; batched matching deferred).
N-4. Per-address position limits and correlated-address clustering as consensus security (analytics only; AEGIS §8.2 rejected as core defense).
N-5. Reputation-weighted market influence (rejected; AEGIS Phase-7 reputation retained only as fee-rebate analytics outside consensus).
N-6. Multi-asset collateral baskets (single NUM; §17.1).
N-7. Sybil-proof usage metrics (usage metrics are cost-weighted, not identity-proofed).

XCM relationships in v1 are exactly two: Asset Hub ⇄ futarchy chain reserve transfers of NUM (and DOT for fees), and treasury-authorized transfers to the Coretime chain for renewals. No cross-chain `Transact` governance in either direction (§19).

## 5. Runtime Composition

### 5.1 Pallet map

Cohesion rule applied: pallets are bounded by *trust domain and settlement lifecycle*, not by noun. The conditional ledger and the market maker are separate because the ledger is the solvency-critical custody domain (small, frozen early, heavily verified) while markets are the evolving pricing domain. Epoch orchestration and the decision rule share one pallet because every decision input is epoch-phase-scoped state.

### 5.2 Custom pallet implementation specifications

Format per pallet: purpose/trust boundary; `Config`; storage (all bounded, max-size argued); calls (origin, deposit, preconditions, effects, events, weight drivers, idempotency, atomicity); hooks (budget + overload behavior); errors; migrations; tests; audit concerns. Rust sketches are illustrative signatures, not boilerplate.

---

#### 5.2.1 `pallet-conditional-ledger`

**Purpose / trust boundary.** Sole custodian of market collateral and sole mint/burn authority for conditional positions. Everything else in the system may fail without loss of trader principal so long as this pallet's invariants hold. It exposes *no* admin calls, *no* general asset-management surface, and no configuration that can violate conservation.

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
    type Collateral: fungibles::Mutate<Self::AccountId, AssetId = AssetId, Balance = Balance>; // NUM via pallet-assets
    type NumAssetId: Get<AssetId>;
    type MarketAuthority: EnsureOrigin<Self::RuntimeOrigin>;    // internal: pallet-market only
    type ResolveAuthority: EnsureOrigin<Self::RuntimeOrigin>;   // internal: pallet-epoch only
    type SettleAuthority: EnsureOrigin<Self::RuntimeOrigin>;    // internal: pallet-welfare/oracle path only
    type MaxPositionsPerAccount: Get<u32>;                      // default 64
    type PalletId: Get<PalletId>;                               // escrow account derivation
    type WeightInfo: WeightInfo;
}
```

`VaultState ∈ { Open, Resolved(Branch), ScalarSettled }`. Escrow held on the pallet's derived sovereign account in `pallet-assets` — plain balance, no holds required, no ED interaction because the pallet account is whitelisted as a sufficient-asset holder with existential state maintained by a 1-unit genesis endowment (§10.5).

Note on I-8 (SGF §9.3 "settlement perpetuity") versus bounded state: SGF makes claims perpetual; unbounded state is unacceptable on a parachain. Resolution: `RedemptionArchiveDelay = 1 year of blocks`; after reaping, unredeemed claims remain redeemable through a Merkle-archived claims procedure executed by a TREASURY-class proposal (deliberate v1 compromise, recorded in §31).

**Hooks:** none. This pallet does no automatic work (I-20 trivially satisfied).

**Errors:** `VaultNotOpen`, `AlreadyResolved`, `NotResolved`, `InsufficientPosition`, `BelowMinimum`, `TooManyPositions`, `ArithmeticOverflow` (all conservation math is checked; overflow aborts the extrinsic).

**Invariants (machine-checked in `try-state`):** the full set I-1…I-5 of §23, e.g. `escrowed(pid) == branch_pairs(pid) + Σ_b scalar_sets(pid,b)` pre-resolution.

**Tests:** property tests over random op sequences asserting conservation and annulment (§24.3); differential redemption tests vs. the Python reference model; fuzz on rounding at `MinSplit` boundaries.

**Audit concerns:** rounding direction in `redeem_scalar` (must never over-pay: LONG rounds down, SHORT takes remainder within a paired set — §10.4); escrow-account ED edge cases; reap-vs-late-redeemer race.

#### 5.2.2 `pallet-market`

**Purpose / trust boundary.** Prices information; touches trader NUM only through the ledger's split/merge and its own fee transfers. A total failure of this pallet can produce bad prices but cannot mint claims or move escrow.

`Config` highlights: `type Ledger`, `type Constitution`, `type Treasury` (POL + fee routing), `MaxMarketsPerProposal = 7` (1 decision pair = 2 books + 4 gate books + margin), `MaxLiveMarkets = MaxLiveProposals·7 + 1` Baseline, `ObservationInterval = 10 blocks (60 s)`, `TwapCheckpoints = 8` per market.

**Storage:** `Markets: map MarketId → MarketState { book: LmsrBook, fees_accrued, twap: TwapAccumulator, phase, class_params_frozen }` — bounded by `MaxLiveMarkets ≈ 225`; settled markets reaped by keeper crank after cohort settlement + archive delay. `LmsrBook { b: FixedU64F64, q_long: i128, q_short: i128 }`. `TwapAccumulator { last_obs_block, last_obs_price: Fixed, cum: u256-as-(u128,u128), window_checkpoints: BoundedVec<(BlockNumber, Cum), 8> }` — checkpoints at decision-window and trailing-window boundaries give O(1) window means.

**Calls:**

**Hooks:** none in `on_initialize` beyond a constant-time phase-cursor read. All observation work is crank-driven (I-20). Missing cranks ⇒ staleness accounting in the TWAP (⇒ decision-grade failure ⇒ status quo), never wrong data.

**Invariants:** maker loss per book ≤ `b·ln2 + rounding_bound` (I-12); TWAP recorded drift per interval ≤ κ (I-13); fee conservation.

**Audit concerns:** fixed-point exp/ln domain enforcement `|q_L − q_S|/b ≤ 48`; maker-adverse rounding on both buy and sell; observation/trade same-block interaction.

---

#### 5.2.3 `pallet-epoch`

**Purpose.** The clock and the judge. Owns the epoch phase machine (§9), proposal registry and lifecycle (§8), slot allocation, resource locks, decision engine (§14), cohort registry, and is the only caller of `ledger.resolve` (I-3) and only writer to the execution queue (I-9).

`Config`: `EpochLength = 302_400 blocks`, phase offsets (§9.1), `MaxLiveProposals = 32` (all states), `N_active = 5` trading slots, `MaxResourceDomainsPerProposal = 8`, `MaxCallsPerBatch = 16`, `MaxPayloadBytes = 64 KiB` (preimage-side), class tables from constitution.

**Storage:** `Proposals: map ProposalId → Proposal` (bounded per §7); `EpochOf: EpochInfo { index, phase, phase_start_block }`; `Slots: BoundedVec<ProposalId, 5>`; `ResourceLocks: map ResourceId → ProposalId` (≤ 32·8); `Cohorts: map EpochId → CohortInfo` (≤ 4 live per I-21, older reaped after settlement); `DecisionRecords: map ProposalId → DecisionRecord` (reaped with proposal); `IntakeQueue: BoundedVec<ProposalId, 64>` (overflow ⇒ `IntakeFull` error, bond refused — hard bound, never silent growth).

**Calls:** `submit(class_hint, payload_hash, resource_domains, metric_ref)` (Signed + class bond held); `withdraw` (before qualification, full refund); `tick()` (keeper: advances phase when block threshold reached — O(1) plus a bounded per-tick work list of ≤ `TickBatch = 10` items; repeated ticks drain work idempotently); `decide(pid)` (keeper, only in Decide phase, runs §14); `extend/finalize` internal to decide; `settle_cohort(epoch, batch)` (keeper, bounded batches).

**Hooks:** `on_initialize` does exactly one comparison (current block vs. next scheduled boundary) and sets a `TickNeeded` flag — weight constant. All heavy work is in `tick()` cranks (I-20). If nobody cranks: phases stall in place; trading windows are block-ranges so a late `decide` still evaluates the same recorded accumulator data; stalls beyond `StaleEpochBound = 7 days` force-reject all in-flight proposals on the next tick (status-quo default).

**Audit concerns:** exactly-once resolve; slot allocation determinism; resource-lock release on every terminal path; reorg safety (all decisions read finalized parachain state by construction — parachain blocks are final once relay-finalized).

---

#### 5.2.4 `pallet-welfare`

**Purpose.** Computes W deterministically. Maintains bounded per-block counters (fees burned/paid in NUM, XCM send/fail counts, block-authored bitmap per session, weight utilization sum, distinct fee-payer HyperLogLog sketch — fixed 4 KiB, cost-weighted), snapshots them per epoch, combines with oracle-attested components, produces pillar values, gate values, `W_e`, breach flags, and `s` per cohort.

**Storage:** `Counters: CountersOf` (fixed-size struct, updated in `on_finalize` with a **constant** weight budget — every counter update is O(1)); `Snapshots: map EpochId → Snapshot` (kept `H + challenge + 12` epochs for normalization bands, then pruned — bound ≈ 20); `MetricSpecs: map MetricSpecVersion → SpecRecord { content_hash, activation_epoch, params }` (bounded 16 versions, values-controlled); `GateBreachFlags: map EpochId → { s_breached: bool, c_breached: bool, day_bitmap: [u32; 2] }`.

**Calls:** `note_external_component(...)` — internal from `pallet-oracle` only; `snapshot(epoch)` keeper crank at epoch boundary (bounded: fixed component count ≤ 16); values-origin `register_spec` / `activate_spec` (activation ≥ 2 epochs out; open cohorts always settle on creation-time spec — I-16).

**Hooks:** `on_finalize` constant-cost counter updates only. Overload impossible by construction (no iteration).

---

#### 5.2.5 `pallet-oracle`

**Purpose.** Settlement facts that cannot be derived on-chain. Bonded optimistic game per (epoch, component): `report(component, epoch, value, evidence_hash)` with bond `B_0` (signed reporter from bonded registry); 48 h challenge window; `challenge(...)` with matching bond opens round 2 at 2×; `R_max = 3` rounds; terminal round escalates to the `OracleResolution` values track (5-day conviction referendum restricted to the adjudication call); deadline breach ⇒ **neutral settlement** — component carries last-valid value and cohorts referencing it settle with that component's weight renormalized away; if the disputed component is a *gate input*, affected cohorts VOID (par refund, decisions already made stand, queued executions depending on the epoch's gates cancel) — GFP §9.7 fail-static rule.

OCWs MAY prepare and submit reports but submissions are ordinary signed extrinsics from bonded keys; nothing in consensus trusts OCW execution. Slashing: losing side of an adjudicated round forfeits bond (40% challenger / 60% insurance — GFP §9.5).

**Bounds:** ≤ 16 components × ≤ 4 concurrently-settling epochs × ≤ 3 rounds. All maps reaped at cohort settlement.

---

#### 5.2.6 `pallet-execution-guard`

Specified in full in §18. Owns: `Queue: map ProposalId → QueuedExecution` (≤ 32), `ExecutionRecords` ring buffer (≤ 256, then pruned to indexer), pending upgrade authorization state.

---

#### 5.2.7 `pallet-futarchy-treasury`

**Purpose.** All protocol funds. Accounts: `MAIN`, `POL`, `INSURANCE`, `KEEPER`, `ORACLE`, `REWARDS` (derived sub-accounts). NAV = Σ liquid balances at par + streamed-out remainder − obligations; cross-chain assets (none in v1 beyond in-flight XCM) marked 0 until arrival (conservative, Appendix A Q24). Outflow calls accept only `FutarchyTreasury` origin (from execution guard) and consult constitution rate meters (per-proposal ≤ 5% NAV, rolling 30-day ≤ 10%, rolling 180-day ≤ 30%, per-line budgets). Streams: `open_stream(recipient, total, start, duration)` — linear, claimable by recipient, cancellable by a later TREASURY decision (SGF §8 streaming rule; mandatory for grants > 1% NAV). Meter contention ⇒ execution stays queued and retries within grace (FGP §7.2).

---

#### 5.2.8 `pallet-guardian`

Specified in §20. Membership: `BoundedVec<AccountId, 7>` set by `ConstitutionalValues`; per-member GOV bond held; per-power epoch allowances; every action records `justification_hash` and schedules a mandatory retrospective values ratification; unratified action ⇒ 50% bond slash + recall referendum auto-scheduled.

---

#### 5.2.9 `pallet-constitution`

**Purpose.** The stored half of the constitutional kernel. Typed parameter registry: `Params: map ParamKey → ParamRecord { value, min, max, max_delta_per_decision, cooldown_blocks, last_change, class: ProposalClass }` where `min/max/max_delta/cooldown/class` are **genesis-fixed for kernel keys** and META-amendable within compile-time meta-bounds for others (FGP §8.1). Rolling rate meters (I-7). Capability table: `map CallDomain → CapabilityRule { allowed_origin_class, per_call_limits }`. Resource-domain catalog. Kernel constants (entrenched floors θ⁻, p_max ceiling, timelock floors, VOID rule, guardian scope, annulment requirement) re-exported from the `futarchy-primitives` crate as `Get<T>` consts — they have **no storage representation** and can change only via a Wasm change, which the attestation regime (§18.6) surfaces.

Every origin is produced by exactly one pallet through exactly one code path; none is obtainable from a signed extrinsic, XCM origin conversion, or wrapper call. There is **no path to unrestricted Root** after bootstrap: `EnsureRoot` succeeds only for the internal dispatch the execution guard performs for the two allowlisted `frame_system` upgrade calls, constructed inside the runtime (I-10) — no external origin converts to Root.

`epoch.submit` for CONSTITUTIONAL-class subjects routes to the values track (it is a referendum, not a market); the epoch pallet rejects values-scope resource domains from belief-class submissions and vice versa (§16.4).

### 6.3 `BaseCallFilter` and nested-dispatch closure

`BaseCallFilter = SafetyFilter`, a custom `Contains<RuntimeCall>` that (a) denies the "nobody" row above unconditionally, (b) denies governance-privileged calls unless dispatched with their matching custom origin — enforced again by each pallet's `EnsureOrigin`, giving two independent checks, and (c) recursively inspects wrapper calls:

```rust
impl Contains<RuntimeCall> for SafetyFilter {
    fn contains(c: &RuntimeCall) -> bool {
        match c {
            RuntimeCall::Utility(pallet_utility::Call::batch { calls })
            | RuntimeCall::Utility(pallet_utility::Call::batch_all { calls })
            | RuntimeCall::Utility(pallet_utility::Call::force_batch { calls })
                => calls.len() <= MAX_NESTED && calls.iter().all(Self::contains),
            RuntimeCall::Proxy(pallet_proxy::Call::proxy { call, .. })
            | RuntimeCall::Multisig(pallet_multisig::Call::as_multi { call, .. })
                => !is_privileged_domain(call) && Self::contains(call),
            RuntimeCall::Scheduler(..) => scheduled_inner_allowed(c), // values-enactment set only
            _ => static_domain_allowed(c),
        }
    }
}
```

Nesting depth is bounded (`MAX_NESTED = 4` levels, ≤ 16 calls total) — matching the payload bounds — so filter evaluation weight is bounded. Privilege escalation through `utility::dispatch_as` is prevented by filtering that call entirely for external origins; through XCM `Transact` by the XCM barrier refusing `Transact` from all locations (§19.4); through the scheduler because scheduled dispatch re-enters origin checks with the origin captured at scheduling, which for values enactments is the track origin and for anything else never a governance origin.

### 6.4 Why the scheduler cannot bypass revalidation

The scheduler is used solely as `pallet-referenda`'s enactment engine. A scheduled values call dispatches with `ConstitutionalValues`/`OracleResolution` origin and passes the same `SafetyFilter` + `EnsureOrigin` + in-pallet precondition checks at *dispatch* time as a direct call would; the values pallets' own preconditions (e.g. kernel bounds) are evaluated at execution, not scheduling. Belief-side execution never touches the scheduler: `pallet-execution-guard::execute` is the only path, precisely so that maturity, preimage, version, capability and rate-limit checks are repeated at dispatch (§18.2).

## 7. Shared Type System

Defined in the `no_std` crate `futarchy-primitives`, SCALE-encoded, versioned via a `#[codec(index)]`-stable discipline: enum variants and struct fields are append-only; removals require a new type + storage migration. All collections `BoundedVec`/`BoundedBTreeMap`. Numeric conventions: balances `u128` (NUM has 6 decimals at source, represented locally at 6 decimals; GOV 12 decimals); prices/scores `FixedU64` semantics (1e9 scale) at API boundaries, internal LMSR math in 64.64 (`u128`/`i128`).

```rust
pub type ProposalId = u64;                  // monotone, never reused
pub type EpochId    = u32;
pub type CohortId   = EpochId;              // cohort ≡ its origin epoch
pub type MarketId   = u64;                  // monotone
pub type MetricId   = u16;
pub type MetricSpecVersion = u16;
pub type ResourceId = [u8; 8];              // registered tag, e.g. *b"trsy.spd"
pub type ParamKey   = [u8; 16];

/// Deterministic: position identity is pure function of (proposal, branch, kind).
pub struct PositionId { pub proposal: ProposalId, pub branch: Branch, pub kind: PositionKind }
pub enum Branch { Accept, Reject }
pub enum PositionKind { BranchNum, Long, Short }          // 2×3 = 6 kinds per vault

pub enum ProposalClass { Param, Treasury, Code, Meta, Constitutional, Emergency }

pub enum ProposalState {
    Submitted, Screening, Qualified, Trading, Extended,
    Queued, Suspended, Rerun,
    Rejected(RejectReason), Executed, FailedExecuted,
    Measuring, Settled, Cancelled, Expired,
}
pub enum RejectReason {
    NotDecisionGrade, GateVetoSurvival, GateVetoSecurity, HurdleNotMet,
    ConvergenceFailed, SecondExtensionFailed, ProcessHold, ConstitutionViolation,
    ResourceConflict, RateLimited, VetoUpheldByReview, StaleQueue, PayloadReverted,
}

pub enum EpochPhase { Intake, Qualify, Seed, Trade, Decide, Review, Execute, Housekeeping }

pub enum DecisionOutcome { Adopt, Reject(RejectReason), Extend }
pub enum GateType { Survival, Security }
pub struct OracleRound { pub component: MetricId, pub epoch: EpochId, pub round: u8,
                         pub bond: Balance, pub value: FixedU64, pub deadline: BlockNumber }

pub struct RuntimeVersionConstraint { pub spec_name: [u8;16], pub spec_version: u32 }

pub struct Proposal {
    pub id: ProposalId, pub class: ProposalClass, pub proposer: AccountId,
    pub payload_hash: H256,                    // preimage hash of the exact SCALE-encoded batch
    pub payload_len: u32,                      // ≤ 65_536
    pub resource_domains: BoundedVec<ResourceId, ConstU32<8>>,
    pub metric_spec: MetricSpecVersion, pub bond: Balance,
    pub state: ProposalState, pub epoch: EpochId,
    pub decision_market: Option<(MarketId, MarketId)>,          // (accept, reject)
    pub gate_markets: Option<[MarketId; 4]>,                    // (S,C)×(acc,rej)
    pub version_constraint: RuntimeVersionConstraint,
    pub extended: bool, pub delayed_once: bool,
    pub attestation_hash: Option<H256>,        // CODE/META kernel attestation
}
pub struct ExecutionRecord { pub pid: ProposalId, pub block: BlockNumber,
    pub origin_class: ProposalClass, pub result: DispatchOutcomeCode,
    pub meters_consumed: BoundedVec<(ParamKey, Balance), ConstU32<4>> }
```

Maximum encoded lengths: `Proposal ≤ 512 B`; `MarketState ≤ 384 B`; `Snapshot ≤ 2 KiB`. These bounds feed PoV-size budgeting.

Idempotency: every keeper call re-invoked in the same state is a no-op returning `Ok` with `NoOp` event or a benign error; no transition is repeatable with side effects. No rejection, timeout, veto, or expiry path enqueues execution (I-15 checked by state-machine model checking, §24.5).

Measurement horizon k = 2: cohort e measures over epochs e+1, e+2; snapshot(e+2) finalizes and survives its challenge window during epoch e+3's opening days; settlement at e+3 Housekeeping ⇒ ~63–66 days capital duration for scalar positions (branch-NUM redeems at finalization, so only deliberate scalar exposure waits — SGF §5.1).

### 9.2 Cohort machine

`CohortInfo { epoch, proposals: BoundedVec<ProposalId, 5>, status: Measuring{until} | AwaitingOracle | Settling{cursor} | Settled | Void }`. At most 4 cohorts non-terminal simultaneously (2 measuring + 1 awaiting oracle/challenge + 1 settling) — I-21. `settle_cohort(e, batch)` processes ≤ 100 (market, position-total) items per call; cursor-resumable; settlement completeness is a precondition for cohort reap, and reap is a precondition for the epoch counter to prune snapshot e−20.

Overlap picture:

```
epoch:        e        e+1      e+2      e+3
cohort e:     trade →  measure  measure  settle
cohort e+1:            trade →  measure  measure   (settles e+4)
cohort e-1:   measure  measure  settle
```

## 10. Conditional Ledger and Solvency Model

### 10.1 Storage schema

Given in §5.2.1. Escrow lives as NUM balance on the pallet sovereign account; per-vault `escrowed` is the internal ledger of that pooled balance and `Σ_pid escrowed(pid) ≤ balance(sovereign)` is invariant I-4 (strict equality up to the 1-unit genesis endowment and swept dust).

### 10.2 Operation semantics and accounting equations

Let `B(pid)` = branch pairs outstanding, `Q_b(pid)` = scalar complete sets outstanding in branch b, `E(pid)` = escrow. State equations (all checked arithmetic):

```
split(a):          E += a;  B += a          // mints a·AcceptNum + a·RejectNum
merge(a):          E -= a;  B -= a          // burns one of each
split_scalar(b,a):           B_num(b) -= a; Q_b += a    // burns branch-NUM, mints a LONG_b + a SHORT_b
merge_scalar(b,a):           inverse
resolve(w):        void positions of branch ≠ w frozen; state = Resolved(w)
redeem(a):         burns a win-NUM;   E -= a;   payout a
settle_scalar(s):  records s ∈ [0,1] (FixedU64, 1e9)
redeem_scalar:     per complete set: LONG pays floor(a·s), SHORT pays a − floor(a·s)
```

**Conservation identity (pre-resolution):** `E = B + Q_Accept + Q_Reject` where each branch-NUM unit is counted inside `B` until scalar-split moves it into `Q_b`. Formally: `E = supply(AcceptNum) + Q_Accept = supply(RejectNum) + Q_Reject` and dual minting keeps the two right-hand sides equal (I-1, SGF §5.1 supply identity).

### 10.3 Collateral-conservation proof sketch

Claim: for every reachable state, total possible payouts ≤ E. Proof by induction on operations. Base: empty vault, E = 0, no claims. Inductive step: `split`/`merge` change E and claims by equal amounts (a unit of each branch is a claim on exactly 1 NUM in exactly one future world). `split_scalar` replaces a claim worth 1 (branch-NUM) by claims worth `s + (1−s) = 1` in the same world — payout-invariant for every s ∈ [0,1]. `resolve(w)` deletes all branch-≠w claims (payout can only fall). `redeem`/`redeem_scalar` decrement E and claims equally, with rounding strictly maker-of-last-resort-favoring: the LONG floor plus SHORT remainder of a paired set sums to exactly `a`, and an unpaired LONG redemption pays `floor(a·s) ≤ a·s`. Hence no operation increases (claims − E); it starts at 0 and payouts never exceed escrow. ∎ (EFP §5.1 solvency invariant, adapted to integer arithmetic.)

**Annulment corollary (I-2):** an account that splits and trades only inside branch b, holding its mirror (¬b)-NUM untouched, is made exactly whole if b voids — its ¬b-NUM redeems 1:1 (SGF §3.4). Enforced structurally: no code path mints a single-branch position against collateral.

### 10.4 Rounding, dust, fees, ED

R-1. All divisions round **against the claimant and in favor of escrow**; `redeem_scalar` uses the paired-set rule above so a holder of a complete set never loses a unit to double flooring.
R-2. `MinSplit = MinTransfer = 1 NUM-cent (10^4 base units)`; positions cannot be created below it; transfers leaving a remainder below it must move the whole balance.
R-3. Fees (30 bps) are charged by `pallet-market` in NUM *outside* the vault (trade cost + fee), routed 50% INSURANCE / 50% POL-offset (GFP §5.0); the ledger never sees fee flows — fee bugs cannot break conservation.
R-4. Existential deposit: NUM is a sufficient asset with `min_balance = 10^4`; the ledger sovereign, treasury sub-accounts and market accounts are endowed at genesis so they can never be reaped; user redemptions below min_balance are routed to the caller's existing balance or rejected with `BelowMinimum`.
R-5. Swept residue (rounding dust + unredeemed after archive delay) goes to INSURANCE, event-logged per vault (`VaultReaped { residue }`).
R-6. Asset recovery: NUM sent directly to pallet accounts outside protocol flows is recoverable only by TREASURY-class proposal (`recover_foreign`), never by any admin.

### 10.5 Failure-state behavior

VOID (from oracle deadlock on gate inputs or constitutional emergency): vault resolves as `Resolved(Reject)`-equivalent for decision purposes, but **both** branch-NUM kinds redeem 1:1 (par refund) and scalar sets redeem at `s = 0.5` per complete-set rule — total payout equals E exactly; fees are sunk (GFP §9.7). Decisions dependent on the voided epoch revert to REJECT; queued executions cancel (I-15).

### 10.6 Property-test specification

PT-1 conservation: random op sequences (10^6 cases) maintain §10.2 identities. PT-2 annulment: for random trader strategies confined to one branch, void ⇒ net principal delta = −fees only. PT-3 rounding: Σ payouts over all holders after full redemption ∈ [E − holders, E]. PT-4 no-mint-outside-split: model-based test that supply changes occur only in the four minting ops. PT-5 reap safety: reap never executes while any position balance > 0 unless archive delay elapsed, and archived residue equals Σ outstanding claims valued at settlement.

## 11. Prediction-Market Design

### 11.1 Market inventory per proposal class

| Class                         | Markets                                        | Books |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| PARAM                         | decision pair (ACCEPT-scalar, REJECT-scalar)   | 2     |
| TREASURY ≤ 1% NAV             | decision pair                                  | 2     |
| TREASURY > 1% NAV, CODE, META | decision pair + 4 gate markets (S,C)×(acc,rej) | 6     |
| Per epoch (unconditional)     | Baseline welfare market on s_e                 | 1     |
| CONSTITUTIONAL / EMERGENCY    | none (referendum / playbook path)              | 0     |

All decision and Baseline books are scalar LONG/SHORT on the settlement score `s`; gate books are binary YES/NO on the breach fact (§13). Maximum live books: 5·6 + 1 = 31 per epoch, ≤ 4 cohorts ⇒ ≤ 121 with measuring cohorts' live-branch books (post-decision trading of the live branch continues through measurement as a running forecast — EFP M-1).

### 11.2 Payout definitions

Scalar: within the realized branch, `LONG` pays `s` NUM and `SHORT` pays `1 − s` per unit; sum = 1 collateral unit for every valid `s ∈ [0,1]` (complete-set property). Binary gate books: YES pays 1 iff the deterministic breach flag for the referenced gate and horizon is set, else 0; voided-branch instruments pay 0 (branch-NUM refunds principal per §10).

### 11.3 LMSR mathematics

Two-outcome LMSR per book with subsidy parameter b (NUM):

```
C(q_L, q_S) = b · ln(e^{q_L/b} + e^{q_S/b})
p_L = e^{q_L/b} / (e^{q_L/b} + e^{q_S/b}) ;  p_S = 1 − p_L
cost(buy Δ LONG) = C(q_L + Δ, q_S) − C(q_L, q_S)
displacement:  Δ = b·(logit p′ − logit p);  cost = b · ln((1 − p)/(1 − p′))
worst-case maker loss = b · ln 2   (from symmetric start)
```

(SGF App-A; FGP §4.3.) Subsidy sizing: `b = SubsidyBudget / ln 2` per book; per-class budgets in §21. The maker holds the ledger positions backing its quotes: at book creation the treasury splits `b·ln2 + headroom` NUM through the vault into the book's branch and scalar-splits into complete sets, so every LMSR obligation is pre-collateralized in the ledger — the maker cannot be insolvent (I-12 ties book state to held sets).

### 11.4 Fixed-point implementation (`futarchy-fixed` crate)

- Representation: unsigned 64.64 (`u128`, 64 integer + 64 fractional bits); signed ops on `i128` with explicit domain checks. `sp_arithmetic::FixedU128` (verified present) is used at API boundaries; it lacks exp/ln, hence the custom crate.
- Domain: enforce `|q_L − q_S| / b ≤ 48` (prices confined to `[e^{-48}/(1+e^{-48}), …] ≈ [1.4e-21, 1−1.4e-21]`, and practically clamped to `[0.001, 0.999]` for quoting). Trades that would exit the domain are rejected (`PriceBoundExceeded`).
- `exp2`/`log2` via range reduction to `[1,2)` + 64-bit polynomial/CORDIC-style iteration; `ln x = log2 x · ln 2` with `ln 2` as a 64.64 constant; log-sum-exp trick `C = max(q_L,q_S)/b·b + b·ln(1 + e^{−|q_L−q_S|/b})` for stability (SGF App-A numerics).
- **Maximum approximation error (normative):** each `exp2`/`log2` call ≤ 2 ulp of 64.64 (≈ 1.1e-19 relative); composed cost function error ≤ 8 ulp; therefore per-trade cost error ≤ `8·2^-64·b` NUM — below one base unit for every b ≤ 10^9 NUM. Verified by differential testing against MPFR at 256-bit precision over ≥ 10^7 sampled points including domain edges (§24.4).
- Rounding: every charge rounds **up**, every payout/proceed rounds **down** (maker-adverse from the trader's perspective, escrow-favoring); cumulative maker benefit is bounded by 1 base unit per trade and swept as dust.
- Overflow: all intermediate products in `u256` emulation (two-limb); checked throughout; overflow aborts the extrinsic, never wraps.

### 11.5 Trading rules

Order size: `MinTrade = 1 NUM`, `MaxTrade = b/4` per extrinsic (bounds single-trade price impact to `|Δlogit| ≤ 0.25`); slippage: `max_cost` / `min_proceeds` mandatory. Fees 30 bps of cost, non-refundable on voided branches. Market close: at decision close the book freezes; live-branch books reopen post-resolution at reduced POL for forecast trading; frozen inventory reconciles to POL at settlement.

### 11.6 Authoritative test vectors (normative; independent implementations MUST reproduce to stated precision)

b = 10,000 NUM (64.64). Start `q = (0,0)`, `p_L = 0.5`, `C = 10,000·ln 2 = 6,931.4718056…`

| #   | Action                        | Exact result (≥ 12 sig. figs)                                                              |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| V1  | cost of buying 1,000 LONG     | `C(1000,0) − C(0,0) = 10000·ln((e^{0.1}+1)/2) = 512.925464970…` NUM                        |
| V2  | price after V1                | `p_L = e^{0.1}/(e^{0.1}+1) = 0.524979187479…`                                              |
| V3  | displace p 0.5 → 0.6          | `Δ = 10000·ln(1.5) = 4054.65108108…` LONG; cost `= 10000·ln(0.5/0.4) = 2231.43551314…` NUM |
| V4  | worst-case loss               | `10000·ln 2 = 6931.47180560…` NUM                                                          |
| V5  | round trip V1 then sell 1,000 | proceeds = cost of V1 (path independence) minus 2×30 bps fees; net −3.077552…−… fee only   |
| V6  | domain edge                   | buy pushing `q_L − q_S = 48·b` MUST be rejected                                            |

On-chain results MUST match within the §11.4 error bound plus one base unit of rounding.

### 11.7 TWAP accumulator (decision statistic)

Per book: observation `o_t = clamp(p_prev_block, o_{t−1}·(1−κ), o_{t−1}·(1+κ))` at most once per 10-block interval, from on-trade updates and keeper cranks; over `k` missed intervals the clamp widens to `(1±κ)^k` (FGP §4.2). κ = 0.5% per interval ⇒ recorded series slew ≤ ~0.5%/min: moving a mean over a 72 h window by δ requires holding displacement for hours against arbitrage (cost model FGP §9.4, SGF §10.1). Accumulator `A += o_t·Δblocks` in u256; checkpoints at window boundaries give O(1) `TWAP(w) = (A(end) − A(start))/blocks`. Staleness: any gap > 50 blocks inside the decision window increments `stale_events`; first event extends the pair once by 3 days, second forces reject (SGF App-B).

### 11.8 Coverage, close, settlement, cleanup

Decision-grade requirements per book (evaluated in §14 step 5): observation coverage ≥ 95% of scheduled intervals in the window; time-averaged effective POL ≥ class floor and POL undisturbed; non-POL contest notional ≥ V_min(class); `|spot_close − TWAP| ≤ Δ_max = 0.05` (EFP §5.5 convergence); `TWAP ∈ [0.02, 0.98]` sanity. Settlement: winning-branch scalar books settle at `s`; gate books at the breach flag; reaping per §5.2.2.

### 11.9 Order-book analysis (required justification)

A batched uniform-price auction layer (GFP §5.0's 60 s FBA) was analyzed and **excluded from v1**: (i) weight — batch settlement is O(orders) at a hostile-controllable order count, requiring its own bounded queue + spam pricing; (ii) state — resting orders are a growth surface; (iii) MEV — the slew-capped previous-block observation rule already removes the decision-relevant intra-block manipulation channel, leaving only ordinary fill MEV of bounded size (`MaxTrade` impact ≤ 0.25 logit); (iv) implementation risk in the solvency-adjacent path. Identified as a Phase-6+ optimization behind a META proposal (§31).

### 11.10 Worked numerical example

TREASURY proposal, decision pair, b = 25,000/branch. Books open at 0.5/0.5. Over 14 days informed flow moves ACCEPT-LONG to 0.560 and REJECT-LONG to 0.520. Decision window TWAPs: `P̄_acc = 0.5585`, `P̄_rej = 0.5210`, Baseline TWAP `= 0.5230`. Reject-leg floor: `r_eff = max(0.5210, 0.5230 − σ=0.005) = 0.5210`. Uplift `= 0.0375 ≥ δ_TREASURY = 0.025` ✔. Trailing 24 h TWAPs 0.5570/0.5222 ⇒ uplift 0.0348 ✔; convergence `|0.560 − 0.5585| = 0.0015 ≤ 0.05` ✔. Gate markets (§13): breach TWAPs S: 0.011 acc / 0.009 rej; C: 0.017/0.015 — under `p_max = 0.05` and within `ε = 0.02` ✔. Adopt. Maker loss realized: ACCEPT book walked 0.5→0.56 ⇒ treasury paid ≈ `25000·[ln 2 − H₂-cost residual] ≈ 1,507` NUM of divergence subsidy to informed traders (computed exactly as `C(final) − C(0) − revenue`, bounded by 17,329).

## 12. Welfare Function

### 12.1 Composite (normative)

```
W_e = g(S_e; θS⁻, θS⁺) · g(C_e; θC⁻, θC⁺) · GeoComposite(P_e, A_e)
GeoComposite(P, A) = max(P, ε)^{wP} · max(A, ε)^{wA},  wP + wA = 1,  ε = 0.01
g(x; lo, hi) = 0                         if x < lo
             = 3t² − 2t³, t=(x−lo)/(hi−lo)  if lo ≤ x < hi
             = 1                          if x ≥ hi
Defaults: θS⁻=0.90 θS⁺=0.98 θC⁻=0.85 θC⁺=0.95 wP=0.60 wA=0.40
```

All pillar values, gates and W in `FixedU64` (1e9) on [0,1]. Gates from GFP §2.2–2.3; geometric inner composite from EFP §3 (a collapsed P or A cannot be bought back by the other pillar; the ε floor keeps W finite and bounds the log-slope). Floors θ⁻ are kernel-entrenched: tightening is CONSTITUTIONAL-class; loosening requires the entrenched 80%-supermajority values path (§16.3).

**Settlement score:** `s_e = W measured over the cohort's horizon`, specifically `s = GeoMean(W_{e+1}, W_{e+2})` — already in [0,1], so no EFP-style ratio/anchor mapping is needed (ADR-6 records the rejection of anchor-ratio settlement).

### 12.2 Normalization discipline (GFP §2.5, normative)

Each raw metric: winsorize at the 5th/95th percentile of the trailing 12 finalized epoch values, `log1p` for heavy-tailed series, min–max map to [0,1]. Normalization constants for epoch e are computed from Snapshot(e−1) history and **frozen at epoch open before any epoch-e market opens**. Reflexivity exclusions (kernel): no input may be a price from the protocol's own markets; GOV market price is excluded from W (GFP §3.5).

Excluded from binding W (kernel): raw tx count, unadjusted TVL, GOV price, any protocol-market price (GFP §3.3/3.5; baseline directive).

### 12.4 MetricSpec record (every component, normative fields)

`{ id, formula_ref (content hash of the canonical spec document), units, fixed-point repr, source class ∈ {onchain, relay-derived, attested}, sampling cadence, normalization rule, sanity bounds, missing-data rule, enumerated gaming vectors + minimum manipulation-cost estimate, challenge procedure, version, activation_epoch (≥ current + 2), in-flight rule: open cohorts settle on creation-time version (I-16) }`. Registering a spec missing the gaming-vector section MUST be rejected (FGP §3.1 Goodhart clause).

### 12.5 Gates acting twice + dead-man switch

Ex post: gates inside W zero realized welfare on breach. Ex ante: gate markets veto (§13). Deterministic **daily breach flags**: each epoch day, `S_daily`/`C_daily` from that day's counters; flag set iff below θ⁻ (drives gate-market settlement and the guardian hard-gate suspension power). Dead-man: if no parachain block finalizes for 4,800 relay blocks (~8 h) or a snapshot is > 4 days overdue, the execution queue freezes, open decision windows extend day-for-day, the epoch clock pauses (GFP §4.3); recovery runs one proposal-free epoch.

### 12.6 Input provenance classes

On-chain (counters), relay-derived (relay-parent data via `cumulus-pallet-parachain-system`'s validation data — **[VERIFY exact accessible fields on stable2603 at implementation]**), attested (bonded oracle §15). XCM-delivered oracle data from third-party oracle chains is analyzed and excluded as settlement source in v1 (§19.6).

## 13. Gate-Risk Markets

For CODE, META and TREASURY > 1% NAV: four binary books per proposal — question: "Conditional on ADOPT (resp. REJECT), will the `S` (resp. `C`) daily floor breach flag be set on ≥ 1 day during epochs e+1…e+2?" (GFP §5.3 M3b). Instruments: YES/SHORT-YES complete sets against branch-NUM in the corresponding branch; settlement from the deterministic breach flags; unrealized branch voids. Subsidy b = 7,500 NUM each.

**Veto tests (evaluated before any welfare comparison; kernel-ordered):**

```
veto  iff  p̂ᵍ_adopt > p_max(g)            (absolute ruin cap, default 0.05, kernel ceiling 0.10)
       or  p̂ᵍ_adopt > p̂ᵍ_reject + ε(g)    (relative test, default 0.02)
       for either g ∈ {S, C}
```

No welfare margin overrides a veto (G-4, I-14). PARAM and small TREASURY use conservative static classification instead: their capability envelopes (bounded, reversible deltas; spend ≤ 1% NAV) are certified at class definition to lie below the gate-relevant blast radius, and the classification itself is META-governed (resolves baseline item 10's open question). The relative test subtracts ambient risk in the spirit of AEGIS §6.7's baseline-risk correction while remaining conditional-market-native.

            let (pa, pr) = (twap_full(gm[g].adopt), twap_full(gm[g].reject));
            if pa > P_MAX[g] || pa > pr + EPS[g] {
                return Reject(match g { Survival => GateVetoSurvival, Security => GateVetoSecurity });
            }                                                                // 4. absolute + relative caps

    }

    Adopt
}
```

TWAPs are the capped accumulator means of §11.7; a single block cannot move them by more than κ (I-13). A second insufficiency/disagreement always rejects (or rolls over per class rule: PARAM MAY resubmit after 14 days; CODE/META must resubmit fresh) — never a noisy PASS. Supplementary close-randomization is **disabled in v1** (Appendix A Q14: no verified bias-resistant parachain randomness).

## 15. Oracle and Dispute System

### 15.1 Adapter hierarchy

Priority order (SGF §7.1): (1) on-chain deterministic — no oracle at all; (2) relay-derived — read from validation data, deterministic; (3) bonded optimistic attestation — everything else. Only class-3 components enter the dispute system.

### 15.2 Reporters and rounds

Reporter registry: permissionless entry with `ReporterStake = 100,000 NUM` held; ≥ 3 registered reporters required before any attested component may be admitted to a MetricSpec. Per (component, epoch):

1. **Report** (within 2 days of epoch end): `report(component, epoch, value, evidence_hash)` — Signed by a bonded reporter, per-round bond `B_0 = 10,000 NUM` held; evidence must be retrievable (content-addressed raw data + recomputation instructions per the MetricSpec); unretrievable evidence is treated as absent (GFP §9.1).
2. **Challenge window** (48 h / 28,800 blocks): anyone MAY `challenge(component, epoch, counter_value, evidence_hash)` posting the current-round bond. Unchallenged ⇒ value final.
3. **Escalation**: bonds double per round, `R_max = 3` rounds. Where the spec permits deterministic recomputation from committed raw data, any keeper may submit a `recompute_proof` resolving the round mechanically; otherwise the round resolves by counter-report + counter-challenge.
4. **Terminal adjudication**: round-3 disputes escalate to the `OracleResolution` values track — a 5-day conviction referendum whose only admissible call is `oracle.adjudicate(round_id, verdict)`. Trust assumption documented: this backstop is stake-weighted (A-3) and exists to make earlier-round lying unprofitable, not to be used routinely (FGP §6).
5. **Slashing**: adjudicated-wrong side forfeits round bonds — 40% to the honest counterparty, 60% to INSURANCE (GFP §9.5). Reporter stake is slashed 50% on a second adjudicated-false report; ejected on the third.
6. **Latency cap**: total ≤ 2 d report + 3×(2 d) rounds + 5 d terminal + 2 d enactment ≈ **15 days** hard cap; the cohort-settlement schedule (§9.1) budgets for it.
7. **Neutral settlement**: deadline breach or no-report ⇒ component carries last valid value with the epoch flagged; two consecutive flagged epochs ⇒ affected not-yet-settled cohorts recompute W without the component, weights renormalized (EFP §3 rule); if the failed component is a **gate input**, VOID per §10.5. No path settles "forward" on contested data.

### 15.3 Keeper and OCW interaction

OCWs on reporter-operated nodes MAY compute values and submit the signed extrinsics automatically; consensus verifies only signatures, bonds and windows. No unsigned oracle transactions are accepted (`ValidateUnsigned` not implemented for oracle calls).

### 15.4 XCM oracle sources

Deferred (§19, last paragraph): no external oracle chain is a settlement source in v1. Rationale: source-chain finality and staleness would import a foreign trust domain into gate settlement; revisit for price-attestation components ≥ Phase 6 with explicit source authentication (origin allowlist + versioned query), staleness bounds and replay protection.

Conviction locking via `pallet-conviction-voting` (1×–6×, locks up to 32 weeks) is the native ve-analogue (ADR-2). `pallet-preimage` stores referendum calls; `pallet-scheduler` enacts with the track origin (§6.4).

### 16.2 Keeping votes out of the beliefs lane

Structural, not procedural: each track origin passes a per-track `Contains<RuntimeCall>` filter enumerating admissible calls; `ConstitutionalValues` cannot invoke treasury spends, PARAM/META parameter keys, market calls or execution-guard calls — such a referendum fails at dispatch. Conversely, belief-class proposals whose resource domains include values-scope domains are cancelled at screening (T4). Neither layer can reach the other's scope (EFP §8's exclusive/exhaustive table, enforced in the filter; I-8).

### 16.3 Entrenchment path

Loosening θ⁻ floors, weakening the VOID rule, expanding guardian scope, or amending the entrenchment rule itself requires the `entrenched` track (80% approval, 20% support, 4-epoch enactment during which Baseline markets for post-activation epochs already trade — GFP §10.5's "priced second opinion") **and** a passing META market. Both layers must independently consent.

## 17. Treasury and Protocol-Owned Liquidity

### 17.1 Collateral: NUM

NUM = **USDC issued on Polkadot Asset Hub** (Assets-pallet ID **1337 [VERIFY at implementation]**), reserve-based XCM transfer, local representation in the `ForeignAssets` instance keyed by canonical Location `(parents: 1, X3(Parachain(1000), PalletInstance(50), GeneralIndex(1337)))` **[VERIFY pallet-instance index]**, 6 decimals preserved, `min_balance = 10^4` (1 cent), sufficient asset. Rejected: multi-asset basket (fragments the ≤ 31-book liquidity budget, adds intra-basket oracle complexity, breaks settlement fungibility — baseline §15 analysis). USDT judged equivalent on liquidity; USDC selected for issuer-attestation tooling; the choice is swappable via the collateral-migration procedure: META + values decision admits the successor, freezes new-market creation in legacy NUM, runs off open cohorts, migrates treasury. Depeg monitoring: attested 30-day median price feed (never a settlement input); sustained deviation > 2% for 24 h arms guardian playbook `PB-DEPEG` (freeze new market creation; open markets unaffected — payouts are NUM-denominated by construction, GFP F12).

### 17.2 Accounts, budgets, controls

Accounts (derived sub-accounts of `pallet-futarchy-treasury`): `MAIN`, `POL`, `INSURANCE`, `KEEPER`, `ORACLE`, `REWARDS`.

| Control              | Rule (defaults = simulation hypotheses)                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-proposal outflow | ≤ 5% NAV (kernel ceiling 10%)                                                                                        |
| Rolling caps         | ≤ 10% NAV / 30 d; ≤ 30% NAV / 180 d (monotone meters, I-7)                                                           |
| Asset exposure       | single-asset NUM; GOV holdings marked 0 in spendable NAV                                                             |
| POL budget           | subsidy spend ≤ 0.75% NAV per epoch, hard cap; slots shrink to fit (GFP F11)                                         |
| Keeper budget        | 3,000 NUM/epoch metered rebates                                                                                      |
| Oracle budget        | reporter fees + escalation float, per-epoch line                                                                     |
| Proposer rewards     | PARAM 500; TREASURY/CODE min(0.05%·Ask, 25k); META 25k NUM — paid on Executed                                        |
| Streams              | mandatory for grants > 1% NAV; linear, recipient-claimable, cancellable by a later TREASURY decision (SGF §8)        |
| NAV                  | liquid NUM at par + undisbursed stream remainders − obligations; in-flight XCM marked 0 until arrival (conservative) |
| Meter contention     | execution waits queued and retries within grace (FGP §7.2)                                                           |

### 17.3 POL mechanics

POL enters as dual-minted complete sets on both branches at book creation (decision-neutral by construction — EFP §9: the voided branch's seed is the free mirror of the live one), sized `b·ln2 + headroom` per book; MUST remain undisturbed through the decision window (a decision-grade condition); withdraws at settlement. Realized cost = divergence loss in the live branch = the explicit information subsidy. Fee routing: 30 bps → 50% INSURANCE / 50% POL offset (GFP §5.0).

## 18. Execution Guard and Runtime-Upgrade Path

### 18.1 Queue semantics

`enqueue` is callable only by `pallet-epoch`'s decision path (I-9). `QueuedExecution { pid, payload_hash, payload_len, class, maturity, grace_end, version_constraint, meters_declared, cancelled }`; queue bound = `MaxLiveProposals = 32`.

### 18.2 `execute(pid)` — permissionless, atomic

Checks in order, all at dispatch time:

1. queued, not cancelled, `maturity ≤ now ≤ grace_end`;
2. preimage fetched; hash and length match the trading-time commitment;
3. `RuntimeVersionConstraint` matches live `spec_name`/`spec_version` — mismatch (an intervening upgrade) transitions to `Rejected(StaleQueue)`, requiring resubmission (Appendix A Q18);
4. full constitutional re-check: capability rules per call domain, rate meters, resource locks still held, no guardian suspension, no active hard-gate breach flag, no dead-man;
5. decode batch (≤ 16 calls, ≤ 64 KiB, declared weight ≤ 25% of block limit, dispatch class Normal); re-derive call domains and assert ⊆ declared domains (I-11); recursively apply the SafetyFilter to nested wrappers;
6. dispatch each call with the class origin; the batch is atomic — any item error rolls back the batch's state and transitions per T18;
7. write `ExecutionRecord`, consume meters, release locks, emit `Executed`.

`pallet-scheduler` is deliberately absent from this path: scheduler agendas capture origin at scheduling and would not repeat checks 1–5; the guard is the revalidation point (baseline §13).

### 18.3 Runtime-upgrade flow (CODE or META class)

1. Proposer commits the artifact set: candidate Wasm **hash**, target `RuntimeVersion` (spec_version N+1), **metadata hash** (via `frame-metadata-hash-extension` tooling — verified crate), migration plan with benchmarked migration weight, audit-report hash, kernel **attestation hash** (§2.3(c)). The payload is exactly `system.authorize_upgrade(code_hash)` (verified dispatchable) plus the commitment record write.
2. Markets trade the committed artifact; gate markets mandatory; a values `ratify` referendum MUST be Passed by maturity (checked at queue time and again at execute).
3. After the timelock, `execute(pid)` dispatches `authorize_upgrade(code_hash)` with internally constructed Root restricted to this single call and hash (I-10, I-19). `authorize_upgrade_without_checks` and `set_code*` are filtered for every origin, always.
4. **Anyone** submits the matching artifact via `system.apply_authorized_upgrade(code)` (verified); `cumulus-pallet-parachain-system` performs the parachain code-upgrade signaling to the relay **[VERIFY current go-ahead mechanics on stable2603]**.
5. Migrations run under `pallet-migrations` (verified crate): multi-block, cursor-bounded, benchmarked; `try-runtime` + `try-state` gate the release in CI.
6. Post-upgrade: the guard records the observed spec_version; failed post-upgrade checks on testnet block the release; on mainnet, migration failure follows `pallet-migrations` halt-and-alarm semantics **[VERIFY exact failure semantics]** with pre-audited playbook `PB-MIGRATION` as recovery.

Edge handling: queued-under-N-executed-after-upgrade ⇒ rejected by check 3; storage-version mismatch ⇒ migration framework refuses ⇒ playbook; excessive migration weight ⇒ multi-block spreading within declared bound, else abort; metadata incompatibility ⇒ wallet-detectable via metadata hash; emergency rollback: **none on-chain** — a rollback is a forward upgrade through the same process (limitation, §31); collator binary compatibility handled by the ops release train (§28 runbook).

### 18.4 Reproducibility and supply chain

Deterministic Wasm builds (`srtool`-class **[VERIFY current recommended tooling]**). Every release publishes: source commit, build-environment digest, Wasm hash, metadata hash, and ≥ 2 independent build attestations reproducing the hash. Queue-time checks require the attestation record's presence; verifying its *content* is explicitly social/off-chain (A-4) and stated as such.

## 20. Guardian and Emergency Mode

Membership: 7 accounts elected on the `guardian` track; per-member bond 50,000 GOV held; approval threshold 5-of-7, aggregated inside `pallet-guardian` (not `pallet-collective`, to keep the power surface enumerated).

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `pause_intake`          | ≤ 14 days per activation; affects intake only — live trading windows always run to finalization (FGP §7.3 asymmetry)                                                                                                           | 1 per 4 epochs  |
| `delay_once(pid)`       | one queued proposal, once ever; auto-schedules a Rerun at 2× POL and δ+1 pp; rerun outcome final and undelayable                                                                                                               | 2 per epoch     |

| `activate_playbook(id)` | only while a verified on-chain emergency trigger is active (gate breach flag, depeg trigger, dead-man, VOID); playbooks are preimage-committed enumerated call batches, values-ratified in advance, each with scope and expiry | per-playbook    |
| `suspend_on_gate`       | freeze the execution queue while a hard-gate daily breach flag is active; auto-releases when the flag clears                                                                                                                   | condition-gated |

Kernel prohibitions: cannot enact proposals, move funds, alter market outcomes, install code, modify the constitution, or extend its own authority. Every action emits `GuardianAction { power, target, justification_hash }`, consumes allowance, and auto-schedules a `ratify`-track retrospective review; an unratified action slashes 50% of each approving member's bond and schedules a recall referendum (FGP C-10 mechanics). Sunset: allowances step down at rollout milestones (Phase 6 → delay-once + playbooks only; Phase 7 → playbooks only), enforced as phase-keyed constants; renewal or further reduction is an `entrenched`-track decision. Registered v1 playbooks: `PB-DEPEG`, `PB-MIGRATION`, `PB-ORACLE-VOID` (initiate VOID for a poisoned epoch), `PB-HALT-INTAKE`.

Safety rationale (applies row-wise): kernel floors/ceilings exist so no captured decision sequence can walk a defense to zero — δ cannot reach 0, windows cannot reach one block, κ cannot open flash manipulation, timelocks and grace cannot vanish, p_max cannot exceed 0.10, guardian scope cannot grow (FGP §8.1 envelope argument).

## 24. Testing and Verification

24.1 **Mock-runtime unit tests** per pallet: every extrinsic × every error path × origin misuse.
24.2 **Cross-pallet integration tests** on the full runtime in test externalities: complete lifecycles for all classes; all §30 scenarios scripted as regression tests.
24.3 **Property-based tests** (proptest): ledger PT-1…PT-5, meter monotonicity, TWAP drift bound, LMSR loss bound, state-machine legality.
24.4 **Differential testing**: `futarchy-fixed` exp/ln/cost vs MPFR-256 reference over ≥ 10^7 points including domain edges; decision engine and ledger vs an independent executable **Python reference model** driven by shared JSON scenario vectors (§11.6 vectors are the seed corpus).
24.5 **State-machine model checking**: TLA⁺ (or Quint) models of proposal machine + ledger resolution proving I-3, I-14, I-15, I-18 over all interleavings including guardian, oracle-dispute and VOID events.
24.6 **Fuzzing**: cargo-fuzz on SCALE decoding of payload batches, nested-wrapper filtering, LMSR trade paths.
24.7 **Migration tests**: `try-runtime-cli` (verified to exist) against testnet/mainnet state snapshots for every upgrade; storage-version assertions; `pallet-migrations` continuation/interruption tests.
24.8 **Benchmarking and weight regression**: `frame-benchmarking` for every call and hook; CI gates on > 10% regressions; PoV-size tracking.
24.9 **Multi-node**: **Zombienet** (verified) relay+parachain topologies exercising epoch progression under collator loss, keeper loss and relay finality stalls (dead-man test).
24.10 **State-fork rehearsal**: **Chopsticks** (verified) forked-state dry runs of upgrades and playbooks.
24.11 **XCM integration tests**: Zombienet Asset Hub ⇄ parachain reserve-transfer suites including failure, trap and recovery.
24.12 **Adversarial economic simulation**: agent-based harness (informed traders with planted ground truth, noise traders, arbitrage capital F, scripted manipulators with §22 budgets) across ≥ 10⁴ synthetic proposals; calibrates δ per class to a false-pass rate < 1%; validates A-2; sizes POL (FGP §13.1 M4 pattern).
24.13 **Public testnet contests** with paid bounties for wrongful PASS, oracle corruption or invariant breach (FGP M5).
24.14 **Independent audits**: ≥ 2 firms — scope A (ledger + constitution + guard), scope B (markets + decision + oracle) — plus a mechanism-design review; scope-A re-audit before Phase 6 on any change.
24.15 **Reproducible-build verification** (§18.4) and a **standing bug bounty** from genesis.

```

Dependency direction (strict, CI-enforced): `primitives → pallets → runtime → node`; `client/*`, `simulation`, `reference-model` depend only on `primitives`, `runtime-api` and released metadata — never on pallet internals. `futarchy-fixed` and `futarchy-primitives` have no `frame` dependencies (pure `no_std` + codec), so the reference model and auditors can consume them standalone.

## 27. Deployment and Genesis

27.1 **Genesis state**: runtime Wasm (reproducibly built, hashes published); GOV distribution per token-generation event; NUM `ForeignAssets` entry registered (zero supply until XCM inflow); treasury sub-accounts endowed (GOV for ops, 1-unit NUM existential endowments); constitution registry at §21 defaults; kernel constants baked; MetricSpec v1 hashes registered; playbook preimages stored; guardian genesis slate (values election scheduled for epoch 2); values tracks live; epoch clock armed at block 1 in **shadow mode** (decisions computed, execution guard disconnected — EFP §13 pattern).
27.2 **Bootstrap authorities**: `pallet-sudo` held by a 4-of-6 founding multisig, powers used only for: incident response in Phases 0–2, arming phase flags on evidence, and authorizing the Phase-3→4 upgrade. Every sudo use MUST be announced with a justification hash; the sunset is the removal migration below.
27.3 **Collator keys**: 5 invulnerables, session keys rotated at genesis ceremony; `pallet-collator-selection` candidacy opens Phase 4.
27.4 **XCM configuration**: HRMP/bridge channels to Asset Hub opened during Phase 2 on Paseo, Phase 3 on Polkadot **[VERIFY current channel-establishment procedure]**; initial NUM treasury funding transferred in before Phase 4 arming.
27.5 **Sudo removal**: the Phase-3→4 runtime upgrade (a) removes `pallet-sudo` from the runtime, (b) runs a migration asserting the sudo key storage is purged and that no origin maps to Root outside the guard's internal path, (c) flips the execution guard from shadow to binding for PARAM. From that block, the authority matrix of §6.2 is complete and closed.
27.6 **Reproducibility & chain-spec management**: chain-specs generated from code (`deploy/`), committed, hash-pinned; production genesis ceremony: multi-party build reproduction, key generation on air-gapped hardware, public attestation of genesis hash before relay registration.

## 30. Worked End-to-End Examples

Conventions: blocks relative to epoch start B0; prices in `s`-units; events abbreviated.

**30.1 PARAM proposal (pass).** Alice submits `constitution.set_param("mkt.fee", 25 bps)` (within bounds, Δ=5 ≤ 10): bond 1,000 NUM held at B+2,000; screening derives class PARAM, domain `prm.mktfee`, lock acquired; slot won. B+72,000 books open at 0.5/0.5, b=10k/branch, POL 2×(10,000·ln2+headroom)≈14.5k NUM in sets. Decision window TWAPs: ACC 0.548, REJ 0.529, Baseline 0.531 → r_eff = max(0.529, 0.528) = 0.529; uplift 0.019 ≥ δ=0.015 ✔; trailing 0.0175 ✔; convergence ✔; coverage 98% ✔; V=142k ≥ 100k ✔. `Queued{maturity=B+287,000}`. Guardian silent. Keeper `execute` at B+288,010: preimage matches, version matches, meters fine; dispatched with `FutarchyParam`; `Executed`; bond refunded + 500 NUM reward. Cohort settles at e+3 with s=0.552; ACC-LONG redeems 0.552/unit.

**30.2 Treasury stream.** "Grant 200,000 NUM (2.1% NAV) to Team X over 6 months": class TREASURY, Ask > 1% NAV ⇒ gate markets required + stream mandatory. Bond 5,000+1,000. Gate TWAPs S 0.012/0.011, C 0.018/0.016 — pass. Welfare uplift 0.031 ≥ 0.025 ✔. Executed as `futarchy_treasury.open_stream(teamX, 200_000, start, 180 d)` with `FutarchyTreasury`; 30-day meter consumes pro-rata disbursements. At day 70 evidence sours; a new TREASURY proposal `cancel_stream(id)` passes with uplift 0.041; remaining 122k NUM returns to MAIN (SGF streaming rationale: one big decision became reversible small ones).

**30.3 CODE rejected by security gate.** Proposal swaps the fee-currency router. Decision markets show uplift 0.055 ≥ δ=0.040 — the welfare leg would pass. But C-gate adopt-branch TWAP = 0.081 > p_max = 0.05. `decide` returns `Reject(GateVetoSecurity)` at step 4 — the welfare leg is never even compared (I-14). Bond refunded; markets settle; the ACCEPT branch voids at par for passive holders.

**30.4 Successful runtime upgrade.** META proposal commits (wasm_hash H, spec 102, metadata hash M, migration weight 40% of one block spread over 3 blocks, audit hash, attestation hash). Values `ratify` referendum passes day 12. Markets: uplift 0.071 ≥ 0.060; gates clean. Queued, timelock 14 d. `execute` dispatches `authorize_upgrade(H)` via restricted internal Root; event `UpgradeAuthorized{H}`. A keeper submits `apply_authorized_upgrade(code)`; parachain-system schedules the swap; migrations run over 3 blocks via `pallet-migrations`; guard records spec 102; `try-state` clean. A stale PARAM item queued under spec 101 later hits check §18.2(3) → `Rejected(StaleQueue)` and is resubmitted.

**30.5 Insufficient-liquidity rollover.** A niche PARAM proposal draws V=41k < 100k at decide. First failure ⇒ `Extend` (+3 d). Volume reaches only 67k ⇒ `Reject(NotDecisionGrade)`; bond refunded in full; resubmission permitted after 14 d; next-epoch PARAM subsidy auto-raises 25% (bounded).

**30.6 Oracle dispute.** Reporter R posts integrations-component value 0.62 for epoch 41. Challenger posts 0.44 with evidence that two "integrations" fail the usage bar; round 2 (20k bonds) — R counter-asserts; round 3 (40k) opens; a keeper submits the deterministic usage-bar recomputation proof ⇒ mechanical resolution at 0.44. R forfeits 70k across rounds (40% to challenger, 60% INSURANCE); second offense recorded. Settlement uses 0.44; total delay 9 days — inside the cap; cohort settlement proceeds on schedule.

**30.7 Guardian delay + review.** A TREASURY pass at uplift 0.0251 (razor-thin) coincides with a dispersion alert. Guardians invoke `delay_once` (5-of-7, justification hash J). Rerun next epoch at 2×POL, δ+1 pp = 0.035: TWAP uplift 0.019 ⇒ Reject — the anomaly does not reproduce. Retro `ratify` referendum reviews action J: ratified 71%; no slash; allowance consumed.

**30.8 Hard-gate emergency.** A relay disruption stalls finality; the daily S flag sets (F sub-score collapses). Automatic: `suspend_on_gate` condition freezes the execution queue; dead-man engages at 8 h — epoch clock pauses, windows extend. Guardians activate `PB-HALT-INTAKE`. Relay recovers after 26 h; flags clear; queue thaws; one recovery epoch runs without a PROPOSE phase (GFP F10); the S pillar for the epoch honestly reflects the outage; adopt-branch longs of in-flight cohorts bear it symmetrically with reject-branch (common shock, first-order cancelled in the uplift comparison).

## 31. Known Limitations and Deferred Work

**Deliberate v1 exclusions:** combinatorial futarchy (N-1); Mode A binding fast lane (ADR-7); batched order matching (§11.9); XCM oracle sources (§15.4); cross-chain governance (N-2); multi-asset collateral (N-6); on-chain guardian-free emergency automation; perpetual redemption without archive procedure (§5.2.1 note); randomized close (Q14).

**Unresolved safety questions (open, tracked):** conditional prices estimate correlation dressed as causation — δ, σ and horizons mitigate, none eliminates (GFP §15.4, FGP §14); scalarization discards distributional questions (GFP §15.1); Goodhart pressure is permanent (TM-7); the A-2 arbitrage-elasticity assumption is empirical and must be re-validated each phase; values-layer plutocracy within its lane (A-3); attackers with off-system payoffs (TM-18); markets price means, not tails, outside the two gated tails (GFP §15.3); the entrenchment honesty clause (§2.3) is a process guarantee, not a mathematical one.

**Bulletin Chain evidence artifacts (deferred):** once the Polkadot Bulletin Chain is live on mainnet and an authorization path exists **[VERIFY]**, large off-chain dispute-evidence and oracle-recomputation artifacts (§15) MAY be published to Bulletin by CID, with only the CID/hash referenced on the futarchy chain; this substitutes for ad-hoc archive-node hosting of evidence bundles and adds nothing consensus-critical. Retention renewal is the publishing party's burden; expiry of evidence storage MUST NOT affect the validity of any settled decision.

## Appendix A. Resolution of Required Polkadot-Specific Questions

1. **SDK pin:** `polkadot-stable2603` (umbrella `polkadot-sdk = "2603.0.0"`, branch existence and content verified 2026-07-11). `polkadot-stable2606` exists but is newest-line; 2603 is chosen for patch maturity. Pin exact patch tag at repo creation.
2. **Relays:** Paseo for public testing; Polkadot for production; ephemeral Zombienet relays for CI.
3. **Parachain vs Hub contracts:** dedicated parachain is clearly preferable: the design requires custom origins, `BaseCallFilter` control, bounded hooks, a native two-phase self-upgrade path, per-block metric counters and PoV-budgeted storage — none of which contracts on Polkadot Hub can provide; contracts would also reintroduce the EVM/PVM trust surface the fixed platform direction excludes.
4. **Coretime:** bulk coretime with treasury renewal budget + runbook (Phase ≤ 3 ops multisig; ≥ 4 TREASURY-class authorization); on-demand fallback. **[VERIFY renewal mechanics.]**
5. **Collators per phase:** P0–3: 5 invulnerables; P4–5: 8 (mixed); P6–7: 8–12 with permissionless bonded candidacy.
6. **Standard pallets reused:** §5.1 table (with explicit non-uses: `pallet-treasury`, `pallet-parameters` for governance keys, `safe-mode`/`tx-pause`).
7. **Custom origins/tracks:** §6.1, §16.1.
8. **No-Root enforcement:** §6 (SafetyFilter + origin plumbing), §27.5 (sudo-removal migration with assertion), I-10 negative tests.
9. **Conditional claims:** custom bounded ledger, §5.2.1/§10.
10. **NUM:** Asset Hub USDC (ID 1337 **[VERIFY]**), reserve on Asset Hub, reserve-based XCM transfer, 6 decimals, §17.1.
11. **Fixed-point/LMSR:** `sp-arithmetic` fixed types at boundaries; custom verified 64.64 `futarchy-fixed` for exp/ln/cost, §11.4.
12. **Approximation verification:** ulp-bounded per-op errors; MPFR-256 differential suite ≥ 10^7 points; normative vectors §11.6.
13. **Accumulators without unbounded hooks:** on-trade updates + rebated permissionless cranks; O(1) checkpointed window means; constant-time hooks (I-20), §11.7.
14. **Randomness:** none used. Verified-in-run: no bias-resistant randomness facility surfaced in `cumulus-pallet-parachain-system` for parachain runtimes; relay-derived BABE randomness is epoch-scale and author-influenceable; `pallet-insecure-randomness-collective-flip` is explicitly insecure. Slew-cap + trailing-window + convergence substitute deterministically. Revisit if a verified source ships.
15. **Proposal commitment:** SCALE-encoded call batch stored in `pallet-preimage`; hash + length committed at submission; byte-exact reload at execution, §18.2.
16. **Nested-call filtering:** recursive SafetyFilter over utility/proxy/multisig/scheduler; XCM `Transact` disabled; depth/count bounds, §6.3.
17. **Upgrade authorization:** two-phase `authorize_upgrade`/`apply_authorized_upgrade` behind CODE/META + ratification, §18.3.
18. **Queued call after intervening upgrade:** `RuntimeVersionConstraint` check at execute ⇒ `StaleQueue` rejection; resubmission required, §18.2(3).
19. **Migration bounding:** `pallet-migrations` multi-block cursors + benchmarked declared weights + try-runtime CI, §18.3(5).
20. **External observation authentication:** bonded signed reports, content-addressed evidence, challenge game; OCWs untrusted, §15.
21. **XCM vs bonded oracle data:** all attested data via bonded reports in v1; XCM feeds excluded from settlement (§15.4, §19).
22. **State growth / cleanup:** every map bounded (§7, I-21); keeper-cranked reaping with archive delays (§5.2.1, §9.2).
23. **Relay/parachain failure in S and C:** relay finality-lag sub-score F; block-production U; dead-man switch; incident registry — §12.3, §12.5.
24. **Conservative NAV:** liquid NUM at par, in-flight XCM at 0, GOV at 0, stream remainders netted, §17.2.
25. **Nobody trades / nobody cranks:** decision-grade floors ⇒ status-quo rejection; stalled cranks ⇒ staleness ⇒ extension ⇒ rejection; stale-epoch force-reject; the chain remains safe and merely stops changing (FGP "graceful degradation to zero throughput").

*Internal multi-perspective review (FRAME engineer, XCM security, mechanism designer, numerical methods, economic attacker, upgrade specialist, auditor, SRE) was performed before finalization; its material corrections are already incorporated (notably: rejection of scheduler-based privileged execution, rejection of VRF-dependent mechanisms pending a verified randomness source, the ledger-fee separation of §10.4 R-3, the StaleQueue version-constraint rule, and the bounded-archive compromise on settlement perpetuity). Where evidence was incomplete, the conservative default was chosen and tagged [VERIFY].*
