//! # `pallet-registry` — Incident / Milestone bonded filings (A6)
//!
//! Production FRAME shell (Track-A DoD) over the frame-free functional core
//! [`registry_core`]. The core is the single implementation of the filing /
//! challenge / quorum / slashing state machine (07 §7) and doubles as the
//! Python-M3 ≡ Rust-core ≡ FRAME differential oracle; this pallet adds only the
//! runtime-facing surface it is responsible for:
//!
//! * bounded `#[pallet::storage]` matching the 07 §7 names/shapes (`Filings`
//!   double-map, `FilingCount`, `Aggregates`) plus the ledger-internal
//!   `AckRecords` dedup set;
//! * origin-checked `#[pallet::call]` extrinsics — `Signed` for the
//!   permissionless bonded workflow (`file` / `challenge_filing` / `ack_observed`
//!   / `crank_close` / `close_epoch` / `reap_epoch`), and
//!   [`Config::ResolutionAuthority`] for `resolve_challenge` (the round-2 outcome
//!   arrives from a keeper `recompute_proof` or the `OracleResolution` track — 07
//!   §7 / §5.4, wired in B1a);
//! * real USDC bond custody via `T::Collateral` ([`fungibles::Mutate`]): the
//!   `reg.bond_*` bond is escrowed on `file`/`challenge_filing` and refunded or
//!   slashed 40 / 60 on resolution (07 §5.5/§7), so the registry's held bonds and
//!   the sovereign balance can never disagree;
//! * the cross-pallet reads the core models as pure inputs, injected as Config
//!   seams so A6 does not hard-depend on the A5/A7/A8 FRAME pallets (all wired in
//!   B1a): [`Config::Watchtowers`] (the 07 §4 bonded watchtower registry, →
//!   `pallet-oracle`), [`Config::Welfare`] (the settlement-time consumer, →
//!   `pallet-welfare::note_external_component`), [`Config::Epoch`] (the trusted
//!   per-epoch filing window + frozen spec version, → `pallet-epoch` /
//!   `pallet-welfare`) and [`Config::Params`] (the live `reg.bond_*` tunables, →
//!   `pallet-constitution::Params`, rule 4);
//! * the mandatory `try_state` hook (07 §7 / 15 §1); **no block hooks** (07 §7
//!   "Hooks: none (I-20)").
//!
//! ## One pallet, two instances (07 §7)
//!
//! The pallet is instantiable (`<T, I>`); the runtime deploys it twice — one
//! instance with `Kind = Incident` (`IncidentRegistry`, feeds `C_attested`) and
//! one with `Kind = Milestone` (`MilestoneRegistry`, feeds the A pillar). The
//! per-instance discriminant is [`Config::Kind`]; every other seam (watchtowers,
//! welfare, epoch clock, Params) is shared and routes by that kind.
//!
//! Every mutating call loads exactly the bounded storage cells the core op for
//! `epoch` can touch (that epoch's ≤ 64 filings + the ≤ 4 live `FilingCount` and
//! ≤ 4 `Aggregates` entries), runs the core op, persists the delta, moves USDC,
//! then drains the core event log into `deposit_event`. FRAME wraps every
//! dispatch in [`frame_support::storage::with_storage_layer`], so any later
//! error — including a failed `T::Collateral::transfer` — rolls the persisted
//! storage back with it; the core post-image can never outlive its custody move
//! (G-1).
