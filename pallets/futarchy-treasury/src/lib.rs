//! # `pallet-futarchy-treasury` — solvency, NAV, outflow controls (A9)
//!
//! Production FRAME shell over the frame-free functional core
//! [`futarchy_treasury_core`], which remains the differential oracle
//! (Python M3 ≡ Rust core ≡ this pallet) and the auditor-consumable port.
//!
//! Spec: `docs/architecture/08` (§1 accounts/NAV/outflow controls/streams/
//! meters/calls, §6 keeper economics, §7 intake economics, §8 POL seeding,
//! §9 fees), `02 §4` (`NavView` view type consumed by the B2 `FutarchyApi`),
//! `13 §1/§4` (tunables + storage bounds), `15 §1` (I-7 monotone-meter and
//! solvency try-state coverage — the I-7/I-17 *limits* live as constitution
//! `Params`, the *metering* lives here per the amended 15 §1 / PLAN SQ-12).
//!
//! ## Scope boundary (custody vs. accounting)
//!
//! This pallet is the treasury **policy and accounting** layer: sub-account
//! balances, NAV with reserve haircuts, per-proposal / rolling outflow meters,
//! mandatory-stream vesting, budget lines, VIT issuance metering, and the
//! coretime-renewal call. The **custody** of the underlying assets — moving
//! bridged USDC (`ForeignAssets`, 02 §8) and native VIT via
//! `fungible(s)`/XCM — is wired at the runtime level (B1a/B4); the core (and
//! therefore this shell) tracks the authoritative accounting the custody layer
//! must honour, exactly as the ledger (A2) and market (A3) cores do.
//!
//! ## Origins (08 §1.1)
//!
//! Every ordinary outflow call (`spend`, `open_stream`, `cancel_stream`,
//! `fund_budget_line`, `issue_vit`, `recover_foreign`) requires the
//! `FutarchyTreasury` origin, dispatched by the execution guard when a
//! TREASURY-class decision executes (06 §3 / 09). The bounded Phase-4
//! community-distribution call is the one exception: it requires the
//! `FutarchyParam` origin after the transition has recorded its arming block.
//! `claim_stream` is a Signed recipient call; `execute_coretime_renewal` is a permissionless Signed keeper
//! call, freeze-exempt (D-9). While the one-way bootstrap latch is open, the
//! stored ops multisig may also top up only `OpsReserveProbe` to the live
//! fail-plus-recovery runway ceiling; the first successful positive
//! `FutarchyTreasury` funding of that line closes the path permanently. The runtime wires
//! [`Config::TreasuryOrigin`] over `pallet-origins` (A4/B1a); the mock provides
//! a test resolver.
//!
//! ## Parameters (rule 4)
//!
//! The outflow caps (`trs.cap_proposal`/`cap_30d`/`cap_180d`), the mandatory-
//! stream threshold (`trs.stream_threshold`) and the issuance cap
//! (`iss.inflation_cap`) are **read from `pallet-constitution::Params`** via
//! [`Config::Params`] on every dispatch and threaded into the core's tunable
//! seams — never hardcoded in this pallet. The frame-free core carries the
//! 13 §1 defaults so it and the M3 model behave identically at default
//! parameters; the runtime overwrites them from live records (B1a).
