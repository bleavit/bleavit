# Bleavit Chopsticks environments

These fork-from-generated-genesis configs and manufactured-state cards are the
published Chopsticks environment required by [15 §4.7](../docs/architecture/15-invariants-and-testing.md)
and [02 §11](../docs/architecture/02-integration-contract.md). They contain no
mutable/private upstream endpoint: every scenario starts from the raw chain
spec generated into `zombienet/specs/out/`.

This is the explicit pre-launch form of 02 §11's “fixture state snapshots”:
fork the generated genesis of the release runtime, then apply the checked-in
fixture injections. A live chain does not exist yet. Live-endpoint fork sources
land at Phase ≥ 2 with B8's content-addressed publication pipeline.

## Run

From the repository root, generate specs, source the only pin home, and select
either the base or a scenario:

```bash
tools/env/generate-relay-specs.sh
source tools/env/pins.env
npx "@acala-network/chopsticks@${CHOPSTICKS_VERSION}" --config chopsticks/bleavit.yml
npx "@acala-network/chopsticks@${CHOPSTICKS_VERSION}" --config chopsticks/scenarios/void-epoch.yml
```

Chopsticks at the pinned release requires Node.js **22 or newer**.

Each scenario duplicates the local-only base keys because Chopsticks has no
cross-file include directive, then layers `import-storage` over the same raw
genesis. Raw keys are documented adjacent to their values and are derived from
the real runtime/pallet prefixes (`twox128(module) ++ twox128(item)`, plus the
declared map hashers). Runtime-only PhaseFlags bits 5–7 are injected only in
manufactured drill state under 02 §11's “manufactured precondition failures”
artifact row. Section 02 §7.3 only assigns the bits; 06 §3.3 forbids exposing
their writers as dispatchable calls.

## Run evidence

[`tools/env/run-evidence.py`](../tools/env/run-evidence.py) starts each committed
YAML through the Chopsticks version sourced from
[`tools/env/pins.env`](../tools/env/pins.env). A runner pass attests that the
scenario booted as a fork from the release-Wasm-bound raw spec, every injected
storage cell was verified byte-exactly over localhost JSON-RPC, two blocks were
produced with an advancing header, the live `:code` bytes remained bound to the
release Wasm before and after those blocks, **the scenario's normative card
executed**, and **the mandatory closing try-state check passed**. After
generating the chain specs, building the release Wasm and the `try-runtime`-feature
Wasm, and fetching the pinned binaries, run:

```bash
python3 tools/env/run-evidence.py \
  --kind chopsticks \
  --tier release \
  --wasm release-work/runtime/runtime.wasm \
  --try-runtime-wasm target/release/wbuild/bleavit-runtime/bleavit_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The `base` row is the plain generated-genesis fork and carries no card, so it
attests boot, injected-state, blocks, live `:code` binding, and try-state. Every
row under `scenarios/` additionally carries the `card` check: the runner parses
the adjacent Markdown card's `card-assertions` block, executes it, and
**refuses to name the scenario in `bleavit.env-evidence.v1` unless every
assertion ran** (15 §4.7/§5; SQ-203). A card step that cannot execute yet
declares `blocked_on` with the concrete missing surface, which fails the card
closed — so `--include-gated` can no longer promote a card-less pass into
evidence, and each gate expires mechanically once its surface lands. Before each
scenario, the runner removes its exact database
and SQLite sidecars so an interrupted prior run cannot contaminate the
generated-genesis fork. It removes generated state again before evidence is
emitted, deletes any prior evidence, requires clean committed evidence inputs,
and hashes every committed regular file while rejecting symlinks. Cherry-picked
`--suites` runs are report-only. The `run-evidence.json` schema and byte-exact
inventory contract are documented in
[`tools/release/README.md`](../tools/release/README.md); release assembly remains
the final gate.

## Scenario map and runnability

| Scenario | Spec | Runnable now | Gated assertions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `upgrade-transition` | 15 §4.7; 02 §11; 09 §2.1 | Paired pending/checkpoint/history image is try-state coherent — **stale since 2026-07-20 (SQ-127/SQ-144 ruled: anchor at application time, `(block_number, block_hash)`, one-way try-state); re-image when the implementation lands**; B6 wires the authorize/apply and descriptor-transition surface | A8 enqueue/epoch-handoff wiring for a fully attested queued CODE proposal; frontend transition assertions wait Track F |
| `stale-queue` | 15 §4.7; 02 §11; 09 §1.2(3) | Genuine bleavit/2-vs-bleavit/1 mismatch, future grace, false expedited marker; B6 wires `reject_stale` | A8 wiring to manufacture proposal 1 in `Queued` |
| `void-epoch` | 15 I-26/I-27/§4.7 | Voided vault and real redeem inputs on the current ledger | frontend rendering waits Track F |
| `precondition-failures` | 15 §4.7; 02 §11; 09 §1.2 | Constitution flag injection; B6 wires the live guard refusal surface | A8 wiring to enqueue the otherwise-valid payloads used by the matrix |
| `pb-depeg` | 06 §6.2 | Accountable Guardian post-entry image; block expiry maintenance runs | downstream `market.freeze_creation`/effect-revert surface |
| `pb-migration` | 06 §6.2; 09 §3.2 | Accountable Guardian image + coherent paired guard checkpoint; B6 wires migration controls and the halt bridge | SQ-104 migration-control origin bridge remains open. **SQ-127/SQ-144 ruled 2026-07-20** — the anchor moves to code-application time, `(block_number, block_hash)`, own storage item, try-state relaxed to a one-way implication; this fixture still images the retired paired form and must be re-imaged when the SQ-127/SQ-144 implementation lands (PLAN.md batch **X**). SQ-132(d) ruled the same day (stall is a `started_at` time budget) |
| `pb-oracle-void` | 06 §6.2 | Accountable Guardian post-entry image; block expiry maintenance runs | A8 cohort/ResolveAuthority wiring and downstream effect |
| `pb-halt-intake` | 06 §6.2 | Accountable Guardian image + manufactured machinery bit | A8 wiring and missing intake-pause/effect-revert surface |
| `pb-reserve` | 06 §6.2 | Accountable Guardian image + manufactured reserve bit | missing split-pause/effect-revert call and trigger adapter |
| `pb-ledger-freeze` | 06 §6.2/§6.3; 09 §3.1/§4 | Accountable Guardian/phase image; block expiry maintenance runs | I-4 trigger adapter, missing freeze/effect-revert calls, renewal XCM dispatcher |

The adjacent Markdown card is the normative execution/assertion sequence for
each YAML. Its prose remains normative; the trailing `card-assertions` block is
that prose's machine-readable encoding, one entry per numbered step, each
carrying exactly one of `execute` (a program the runner runs over the live
Chopsticks JSON-RPC), `blocked_on` (the concrete unwired surface that prevents
it), or `discharged_by: try-state` (the card's own closing step, run by the
pinned try-runtime leg). `tools/env/validate-environments.py` enforces the block's
shape; the evidence runner executes it. NOTE(B7): `Epoch` exists as a production pallet but is not
instantiated in the current runtime; B6 now instantiates `ExecutionGuard` at
slot 62. Several 06 §6.2 call names still have no implemented
extrinsic/storage surface. Gated cards remain complete release definitions and
intentionally fail rather than silently weakening an assertion.

The Guardian pallet is instantiated, and every `pb-*` image injects its real
seven-member council, arithmetic bond ledger, activation review, active expiry,
allowance struct, and cursors. The pallet has no per-playbook allowance field,
registered-playbook/active-hold storage, or downstream effect-revert storage;
cards call those gaps out instead of inventing cells. Review scheduling is a
runtime stub and guardian `CurrentEpoch` stays zero until A8 wiring, while
block-number expiry now runs because `Guardian::load()` can succeed.

## Mandatory closing try-state

The evidence runner executes this check (15 §1; SQ-204). Because the runner owns
the Chopsticks process lifetime, it runs the release-blocking check against the
scenario's own configured port before tearing the fork down, using the
`try-runtime-cli` pinned as `TRY_RUNTIME_VERSION`/`TRY_RUNTIME_SHA256` in
[`tools/env/pins.env`](../tools/env/pins.env) and installed by
`tools/env/fetch-binaries.sh`. In evidence mode the binary's SHA-256 must match
that pin, and `--try-runtime-binary` forces report-only. The equivalent manual
command, for debugging a single scenario:

```bash
try-runtime \
  --runtime target/release/wbuild/bleavit-runtime/bleavit_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
  on-runtime-upgrade --checks try-state --blocktime 6000 \
  live --uri ws://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Use the scenario's configured port instead of `8000`. Upgrade scenarios point
`--runtime` at the candidate Wasm; all others use the release Wasm built with
the `try-runtime` feature, which is what `--try-runtime-wasm` names. Any failure
fails the suite and blocks evidence.
