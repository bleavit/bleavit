/// A successful local delivery reveals nothing about remote execution. Likewise,
/// a failure here is a local validate/deliver failure only. The oracle timeout
/// fold is the B1a binding point for [`Self::note_probe_timeout`], the only
/// locally-observable signal that a sent reserve probe received no response.
/// `pallet-oracle::ProbeTimeoutSink` exposes that committed fold directly while
/// keeping the oracle pallet XCM-free; the runtime binding forwards it to the
/// welfare traffic recorder.
/// Remote outcomes are not runtime-readable: when X is partial, R alone drives
/// the C flag. Implementations must never use these signals to improve an input
/// or infer remote success (I-24).
