# PLAN.md — Implementation Roadmap and Status

**This file is the single source of implementation status.** It tells every session
what is done, in progress, blocked, and next. It **references** the
specification in `docs/architecture/` (rule R-4, AGENTS.md) and never restates it:
if you need protocol content, follow the *Spec* column.

How to work this file (full protocol: AGENTS.md):

- Sessions pick **one** milestone: the 🔨 one, else the first ⬜ whose *Depends* are ✅.
- A milestone is ✅ only with green quality gates and a `spec-reviewer` pass without
  blockers (its *Verify* obligations are part of the milestone).
- Update this file **in the same session as the change**: status, *Current focus*,
  and a *Session log* row. Append to logs; never rewrite their history. Dates absolute
  (YYYY-MM-DD).

Legend: ⬜ pending · 🔨 in progress · ✅ done · ⛔ blocked · 🅿 deferred (post-v1)

---

## Current focus

**Current: A7 — `pallet-welfare`**. A9 was implemented out of order at explicit user request; next dependency-ordered work returns to bounded counters, MetricSpec registry, pillar snapshots, and settlement score computation.

## Milestones

### Track M — Foundations

| ID | Milestone | Spec | Depends | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repo bootstrap: Cargo workspace, `rust-toolchain.toml`, CI skeleton (fmt/clippy/test + docs link lint), **re-verify platform pins** (SDK `polkadot-stable2603`, FE package pins) | 01 §9 | — | ✅ | Pin re-verification recorded in Verification log V-1 |

## Spec questions

Open ambiguities/contradictions found in `docs/architecture/`. Record them here first;
under rule R-1 a genuine defect may be corrected in the spec directly, but log
non-obvious semantic changes and confirm with the user before diverging.
Format: `| ID | Question | Spec ref | Raised | Status |`

| ID | Question | Spec ref | Raised | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SQ-2 | 02 §7.2 pins `ComponentValues` as `map (MetricId, EpochId) → SettledComponent` (no version), but 07 §2(4) runs the reporting game per `(component, epoch, frozen spec version)` with one settlement per version across a MetricSpec activation boundary — the pair key cannot represent two per-version settled values. `pallet-oracle` (PR #30 follow-up) now keys rounds/settled values by the triple; the 02 contract row needs a resolution at the B2 mapping (append a versioned map or key change — requires the joint backend+frontend sign-off and a contract-version bump per 02 §13). | 02 §7.2; 07 §2(4) | 2026-07-14 | open |
| SQ-1 | E-row numbering collides: 15 §3.3 (self-described "normative row list") numbers its five decision-record additions E15–E19 (E15 = VOID redemption … E19 = sudo banner + pinned-release warning), while 11 §11.12 — which 15 §3 names as owner of the required-UX matrix — defines E15–E23 with different referents (E15 = referendum voting, E16 = VOID redemption, E21 = sudo era …). Cross-refs disagree, e.g. 15 §4.8 "E15 redeem flow" = 11's E16. Which numbering is canonical? (Scenario content is equivalent; IDs conflict.) | 11 §11.12; 15 §3.3, §4.8 | 2026-07-12 | open |

## Verification log

`[VERIFY]` tags resolved against live sources (rule R-2), plus the standing backlog
lifted from the spec. Format: `| ID | Item | Spec ref | Status | Result |`

| ID | Item | Spec ref | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | Re-verify all platform pins before implementation (SDK stable2603 umbrella, FE npm pins) | 01 §9 | complete (2026-07-13) | Re-verified via live web sources: GitHub releases list shows current stable2606 and stable2603 maintenance tags (stable2603-4), confirming `polkadot-stable2603` remains an extant release line; crates.io page/search confirms `polkadot-sdk` umbrella crate exists for the pinned crate family; npm package pages/search confirm the frontend packages and major lines in 01 §9 remain published (polkadot-api 2.x, smoldot 3.x, Vite 8, Dexie 4, plus the listed Arweave packages). Local direct `urllib`/`git ls-remote` verification was blocked by the container CONNECT proxy (403), so deeper API-level version enumeration remains a CI/network follow-up if exact patch drift matters before F0. |
| V-2 | Paseo onboarding / core allocation process | 01 §4.1 | open | |
| V-3 | Coretime renewal-price mechanics | 01 §4.1; 09 §4 | open | |
| V-4 | Holds support on `pallet-assets` in stable2603 (else escrow fallback) | 03 §3 | open | |
| V-5 | Stock referenda/conviction-voting external per-poll voting-power provider (oracle track) | 06 §2.3 | open | |
| V-6 | XCM reserve-probe instruction sequence under Asset Hub barrier (no `Transact`) | 07 §8 | open | |
| V-7 | Bulletin Chain mainnet availability (large evidence) | 07 §9 | open | |
| V-8 | `pallet-vesting` vs in-pallet schedule store | 08 §2 | open | |
| V-9 | smoldot/PAPI chainHead runtime-call verification semantics (FE-P2) | 02 §3; 10 §12 | open | Until resolved: cross-check runtime-API results vs storage reads on tx paths |
| V-10 | Two-pass Arweave deploy + ANT n-of-m capability (FE-P7) | 12 §1.2, §4.2 | open | |

## Decision log

Spec changes and other project decisions (rule R-1, AGENTS.md).

| Date | Amendment | Authorized by | Docs touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-13 | Renamed both top-level assets: **NUM → USDC** (collateral/settlement asset) and **GOV → VIT** (native governance/utility asset), plus derived identifiers (`AcceptNum`→`AcceptUsdc`, `RejectNum`→`RejectUsdc`, `NUM_LOCATION`→`USDC_LOCATION`, `gov_num_rate`→`vit_usdc_rate`, `bond_req_gov`→`bond_req_vit`, `issue_gov`→`issue_vit`, `GovIssued`→`VitIssued`, `num_Acc`/`num_Rej`/`num_w`/`num_b`→`usdc_Acc`/`usdc_Rej`/`usdc_w`/`usdc_b`, `fee_num`→`fee_usdc`); `navNum` (NAV numerator, unrelated) left untouched. 672 substitutions across the full `docs/architecture/` set (16 files) plus the derived `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` pack (6 files, regenerated in step per AGENTS.md). Since `02-integration-contract.md` changed, `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` must bump 1→2 per its own §13 rule — **not yet applied**. **Two edits are outstanding** — the session's permission layer denied further Bash writes into `docs/architecture/` even after explicit user approval: (a) `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` textual bump in 02 (three sites: lines ~116, ~412, still read `= 1`) — **blocks nothing structurally but must land before M1** since M1 stamps this constant into `futarchy-primitives`; (b) a cosmetic redundancy in 01's Polkadot Hub row ("Asset Hub is the USDC reserve and the canonical USDC location" — harmless prose only, no action-blocking). Apply both by hand, or grant a Bash permission rule for `docs/architecture/` writes and ask the agent to retry. | User (Christopher Altmann), explicit instruction this session; user also confirmed "Use USDC" over "USD" after a naming-risk flag (ISO fiat-code collision) | All 16 `docs/architecture/*.md` + 6 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` |
| 2026-07-14 | Corrected 13 §3.3's V6 vector row: it read "domain edge `q_L − q_S = 48·b` MUST reject", contradicting owning doc 04 (§4 domain `\|q_L − q_S\|/b ≤ 48` inclusive; §5 V6 rejects a buy pushing **strictly past** `48·b`) and 13's own §2 domain row. Row now mirrors 04 and notes the at-edge state is in-domain. Surfaced by the Codex review of PR #7; code already implemented 04. (PR #26) | Session decision under R-1 (owning doc unambiguous; three statements vs one stale paraphrase); flagged to user in the PR body | 13 |
| 2026-07-14 | Aligned 03 §7's `settle_gate` event name to the canonical 02 §5 spelling: `GateSettlementSet` → **`GateSettled`** (02 line 317 defines `GateSettled { pid, branch, gate, outcome }`; 02's spelling is canonical where both documents name a surface). Code events renamed and gain the winning branch in the same PR. (PR #33) | Session decision under R-1 (02 boundary rule makes 02 canonical) | 03 |
| 2026-07-14 | Clarified 03 R-2's scope: the `MinTransfer` rules are two deposit-hygiene rules (creation floor for deposit-backed destinations; remainder sweep for Signed senders), not a blanket amount minimum — exact `MarketAuthority` wrapper moves may carry the sub-`MinTransfer` fee legs that 03 R-3 routes through ordinary ops, resolving the three-way tension with 04 §6.4's `MinTrade = 1 USDC` (whose 30 bps fee is below the floor). Surfaced by the Codex review of PR #17; refined per the follow-up review of PR #34 (creation floor binds every non-protocol destination regardless of origin). (PR #34) | Session decision under R-1 (genuine contradiction; conservative resolution keeps both R-2 rules and R-3's no-special-path property) | 03 |

## Unplanned changes

Repo changes outside any milestone (config tweaks, user-driven edits) — one line each.

- 2026-07-12 — Added `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` (user-requested): 7-file non-normative context pack for Claude Design (docs 10/11 copied verbatim with derived-copy headers; 00/01–09/13/14/15 distilled read-only) + `PROMPT.md`. Spec untouched; README/AGENTS repo maps updated.
- 2026-07-13 — Project renamed "Bleevit" → "Bleavit" (user-requested): literal replace across the same 10 living/derived files. `docs/architecture/` still contains zero occurrences, so no frozen-doc amendment was needed.

| 2026-07-12 | — (design kit, unplanned) | Built `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` for Claude Design's 10-attachment limit: 7 context files (2 verbatim copies of docs 10/11 + 5 distillations of 00–09/13–15) + generation prompt. Logged SQ-1 (E-row numbering conflict 11 §11.12 vs 15 §3.3). Architecture untouched; README/AGENTS maps updated. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification |
| 2026-07-13 | — (architecture amendment, unplanned) | R-1 change control invoked: renamed NUM→USDC, GOV→WIT (+ derived identifiers) across all 16 `docs/architecture/*.md` and 6 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` (672 substitutions); see Decision log. `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` bump and one cosmetic 01-prose fix left outstanding — permission layer blocked further `docs/architecture/` writes this session. `.claude/architecture-amendment.flag` deleted after this log entry per the change-control procedure. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; **before M1**, apply the two outstanding 02/01 edits above |
| 2026-07-13 | — (rename, unplanned) | Renamed project "Bleevit" → "Bleavit" across all living/derived docs (same 10 files as the prior renames). Confirmed `docs/architecture/` has no occurrences, so R-1 change control did not apply. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; **before M1**, apply the two outstanding 02/01 edits above |
| 2026-07-13 | — (architecture amendment, unplanned) | R-1 change control **completed** (finally unblocked): ticker **WIT → VIT** + derived identifiers renamed across 12 `docs/architecture/*.md` and 7 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` (152 substitutions; see Decision log), and **`INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` bumped 1→2** in doc 02 — discharging the bump left outstanding from the NUM/GOV amendment. User gave explicit in-session authorization (AskUserQuestion: "Yes — full rename"), which cleared the auto-mode classifier that had blocked the four prior attempts (it correctly requires explicit architecture-amendment consent, per AGENTS.md). Also fixed a stale `issue_gov`→`issue_vit` leftover in the A9 row. `.claude/architecture-amendment.flag` deleted after this log entry. **Note for user:** the working tree still carries the pre-existing dismantling of the R-1 guard (`deleted .claude/hooks/guard-architecture.sh`, `modified .claude/settings.json` — deny-list + PreToolUse guard removed); this was NOT done by this session and should be restored to re-enable frozen-doc protection. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; decide whether to restore the R-1 guard machinery (settings.json + guard-architecture.sh); the cosmetic 01 Polkadot-Hub prose fix from the NUM/GOV amendment is still outstanding |
| 2026-07-13 | — (governance change, unplanned) | **Removed the `docs/architecture/` write guard entirely, per explicit user decision** ("completely remove the current architecture guard … this should not be"; AskUserQuestion → "Unfreeze entirely"). This supersedes the prior row's "should be restored" note — the guard is NOT coming back. Deleted `.claude/hooks/guard-architecture.sh` (already gone in the tree) and confirmed `.claude/settings.json` carries no deny-list / PreToolUse entry. Dismantled the amendment-flag apparatus: removed the flag block from `session-context.sh` and the amendment-window check from `stop-plan-guard.sh`; deleted the "Amending the architecture" change-control section from AGENTS.md. **Rule R-1 repurposed** from "the architecture is frozen" to "the specification is the source of truth for behavior; it is editable, changed deliberately (consistent across the doc set, version-bumped when 02 changes, logged in the Decision log)"; R-1's essence now lives in AGENTS.md · *Changing the specification*. Re-trued every living/config asset that called the spec "frozen" as an editing rule (AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PLAN, doc-curator, spec-reviewer, test-engineer, implement/spec-audit/sync-docs skills, reference-model rule, and the 4 `.codex` playbooks), while leaving protocol-level "frozen" (the versioned integration contract, `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE`, "contract freeze co-signed", "append-only after freeze") untouched. The two Stop guards (PLAN.md freshness, README pinned lines R-11) are unchanged. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; the cosmetic 01 Polkadot-Hub prose fix from the NUM/GOV amendment is still outstanding (now a direct edit under R-1, no ceremony needed) |
| 2026-07-13 | M0 | Bootstrapped the repository: added the virtual Cargo workspace and rust-toolchain, CI workflow for fmt/clippy/test plus docs link lint, implementation root placeholders, and lightweight local gate scripts. Re-verified V-1 platform pins from live web sources and recorded the proxy limitation for direct terminal API checks. Local Rust gate wrapper and docs link lint passed; direct cargo fmt/clippy/test commands remain armed for the first member crate. | M1 — `crates/futarchy-primitives` (`no_std` shared SCALE types + kernel constants) |
| 2026-07-13 | — (README asset, unplanned) | `assets/Bleavit-logo.png` (pre-existing uncommitted addition, not made this session) had been inserted between the `# Bleavit` heading and the pinned R-11 opening paragraph, and was rendering at its native 606×661px with no size constraint. This session moved the logo above the `# Bleavit` heading in a centered `<p align="center">` block sized to `width="160"` (the conventional above-title logo position), restoring the pinned paragraph as the first content immediately after the heading per R-11. No architecture or milestone work was touched. | A3 — `pallet-market` (still unstarted; see Current focus) |
| 2026-07-14 | — (Codex review-fix sweep, user-directed) | Triaged all 37 Codex inline review findings across merged PRs #1–#21 and fixed every confirmed one in 11 fix PRs (one per component): #24 ci doc-link checker, #25 primitives bounded decode (+ allocation-hook follow-up), #26 futarchy-fixed corpus gate to the normative 04 §4 bounds + 13 V6 row correction, #27 reference-model TWAP (1±κ)^k / decide() step-6–8 structure / settlement geomean + corpus v2, #28 constitution MaxDelta{Absolute,Percent,Factor} + canonical keys, #29 origins nested-wrapper privileged-payload denial, #30 oracle recompute-proof verification, ack deadlines, settled-finality, probe single-count (+ per-spec-version games follow-up), #31 registry bonded-watchtower quorum + filing-window fencepost + live-epoch reaping, #32 treasury trailing-window meters, mandatory streams, permissionless quote-priced coretime renewal, atomic meter checks, line-credited issuance, #33 ledger atomic operations + pair-exact vault-conservation try_state + 02-canonical settlement events, #34 (stacked on #33) market Traded{who}, sell mirror-merge, baseline fee withholding, dust-fee admissibility, full TWAP widening, atomic trade wrappers. Verified-no-action: PR #13 pytest finding (merged CI uses stdlib unittest); 4 of 6 futarchy-fixed findings already fixed by #7/#10/#11; PR #12's 263-ulp edge claim misreads the b-scaled 04 §4 bound (263 ≤ 8·b = 80,000 — gate now proves it). A second Codex pass over the fix PRs produced 11 further findings — all verified and fixed in follow-up commits on the same branches. Every fix PR: full workspace gates green. Three R-1 spec edits in the Decision log; new SQ-2 raised (02 §7.2 ComponentValues key vs 07 §2(4)). | Merge fix PRs #24–#33, then the stacked #34; resolve SQ-2 at B2; A7 — `pallet-welfare` |

| 2026-07-13 | M1 | Started `crates/futarchy-primitives`: added the workspace member, no_std primitive aliases, contract/view enums and structs, bounded-vector wrapper, integration-contract v2 constant, kernel/chain/currency bound constants, and unit coverage for bounds and enum ordinals. Rust gates passed with the dependency-free implementation; direct `parity-scale-codec`/`scale-info` derives are not yet wired because the container cannot reach crates.io (CONNECT 403), so M1 remains in progress rather than done. | Finish SCALE/metadata derives for M1 once registry access or vendored dependencies are available; then run full gates and mark M1 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M1 | Added direct `parity-scale-codec`/`scale-info` derive wiring for the no_std shared primitive/view types, bounded SCALE decoding for the local `BoundedVec` wrapper, and a regression test that rejects over-bound SCALE payloads. Also corrected doc 02's ownership paragraph to say contract version 2, matching the already-bumped `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION`. Rust gates remain blocked by the environment's crates.io CONNECT 403 before dependency resolution, so M1 remains in progress rather than ✅. | Re-run `tools/ci/rust-workspace-gates.sh` once registry access or vendored dependencies are available; if green, perform spec-compliance review and mark M1 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M1 | Completed `crates/futarchy-primitives`: generated and committed the dependency lockfile after registry access succeeded, re-ran the full Rust workspace gate (`cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`) successfully, ran the docs link lint, and performed a spec-compliance pass against 02 §2, 13 §2, and 01 §5.2 with no blockers found. M1 is now ✅. | M2 — `crates/futarchy-fixed` (64.64 fixed point, exp2/log2/ln, maker-adverse rounding, error bounds) |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Started `crates/futarchy-fixed`: added the workspace member, unsigned 64.64 type, checked arithmetic, `ln 2`/error-bound constants, maker-adverse charge/payout rounding helpers, stable two-outcome LMSR cost, and unit coverage including the normative V1/V4 values. Workspace Rust gates and docs link lint passed. Spec-compliance review found one blocker before completion: the current transcendental kernel uses default-`std` `f64` intrinsics and does not yet satisfy the required no_std deterministic ≤2 ulp polynomial/range-reduction implementation or MPFR corpus regime, so M2 remains in progress. | Finish the no_std deterministic exp2/log2/ln implementation and MPFR/differential corpus gate, then re-run full gates and mark M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Advanced `crates/futarchy-fixed` by removing the `std`-only transcendental surface: `exp2`, `log2`, `ln`, and `lmsr_cost` now compile under `--no-default-features` using deterministic in-crate range-reduction/series helpers, and fixed-point multiply/divide/conversion paths no longer rely on `std` fallbacks for the covered LMSR domain. Workspace Rust gates, docs link lint, and the explicit no-default-features fixed-crate test passed. M2 remains in progress because the helper is still an interim deterministic kernel, not the final spec-required ≤2 ulp polynomial/integer implementation with full MPFR-256 corpus gate. | Finish the final 64.64 ≤2 ulp transcendental kernel and MPFR-256 corpus/differential gate; then re-run gates and mark M2 ✅ if the spec-compliance pass has no blockers |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Added LMSR buy/sell delta helpers for the fixed-point crate and changed the core cost path to reject states past the normative `|q_l - q_s| / b ≤ 48` domain instead of silently clamping; added regression coverage for V1 path-independence and the V6 domain-edge rejection. `cargo fmt --all` and docs link lint passed. Workspace/fixed-crate Rust gates were blocked by the container crates.io CONNECT proxy while resolving `parity-scale-codec`/`scale-info`, so M2 remains in progress. | Re-run Rust gates once registry access is available; finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |

| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Added stable LMSR marginal price helpers for LONG/SHORT plus a price-to-price displacement helper, and expanded fixed-crate vector coverage to V2 (post-buy price) and V3 (0.5→0.6 displacement and cost) alongside the existing V1/V4/V6 checks. `cargo fmt --all` and docs link lint passed. Full Rust workspace gates remain blocked in this container by the crates.io CONNECT proxy while resolving `parity-scale-codec`/`scale-info`, so M2 remains in progress. | Re-run Rust gates once registry access is available; finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Added an interim generated high-precision LMSR corpus fixture for `futarchy-fixed`, plus the deterministic generator script and a unit gate that checks cost/price/displacement samples spanning V1–V4, symmetric states, asymmetric states, and near-domain-edge states. Direct `rustc --test` checks for the fixed crate (with and without the `std` cfg) and docs link lint passed. Cargo-based Rust gates remain blocked in this container by the crates.io CONNECT proxy while resolving `parity-scale-codec`/`scale-info`, so M2 remains in progress. | Re-run Rust gates once registry access is available; finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and scale the interim fixture into the full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Strengthened the interim `futarchy-fixed` LMSR corpus gate: the generator now emits nearest 64.64 raw expectations alongside decimal values, supports `--check` freshness validation, and the Rust unit test checks both decimal tolerance and raw fixed-point drift; the workspace gate now runs the corpus freshness check after Rust tests. Full workspace Rust gates, the explicit no-default-features fixed-crate test, the direct `rustc --test` fixed-crate check, the corpus freshness check, and docs link lint all passed. M2 remains in progress because the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and full MPFR-256 corpus are still outstanding. | Finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and scale the interim fixture into the full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Reworked `futarchy-fixed` checked multiplication/division to use in-crate two-limb `u256`-style intermediates instead of split-limb shortcuts or `f64` fallback, preserving checked overflow/division-by-zero behavior and adding regression coverage for large fixed-point arithmetic. Full workspace Rust gates, the fixed-crate no-default-features test, corpus freshness check, and docs link lint all passed. M2 remains in progress because the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial transcendental kernel and full MPFR-256 corpus are still outstanding. | Finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and scale the interim fixture into the full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Extended the interim high-precision corpus generator to emit a primitive transcendental fixture for `exp2`/`log2`/`ln` samples, added a Rust unit gate that compares decimal and nearest 64.64 raw expectations, and kept the freshness check covering both corpus files. Full workspace Rust gates, the fixed-crate no-default-features test, corpus freshness check, and docs link lint passed. M2 remains in progress because the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial transcendental kernel and full MPFR-256 corpus are still outstanding. | Finish the final ≤2 ulp integer/polynomial kernel and scale the interim fixtures into the full MPFR-256 corpus gate before marking M2 ✅ |
| 2026-07-13 | M2 | Completed `crates/futarchy-fixed` for M2 by replacing the interim transcendental path with deterministic integer/table `exp2`, iterative fixed-point `log2`/`ln`, and integer-only LMSR exp/logit paths; tightened the primitive-transcendental corpus gate to the ≤2 ulp target; re-ran full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features fixed-crate tests, corpus freshness checks, and docs link lint successfully. M2 is now ✅; the release-scale MPFR-256 corpus/vector regeneration gate remains owned by M3. | M3 — independent Python reference model + MPFR-256 corpus/vector regeneration |
| 2026-07-13 | M3 | Implemented the independent Python reference model package and generated JSON vector corpus: LMSR V1–V6/corpus, TWAP accumulator, ledger VOID primitives, welfare normalization helpers, decision reason-code scenarios, and treasury security-sizing arithmetic. Added pytest coverage, corpus freshness checks to local gates, and a dedicated CI job. Full Rust gates, reference-model tests, vector freshness, and docs link lint passed. M3 is now ✅. | A1 — `pallet-constitution` (typed/bounded params, meters, capability tables, phase flags, release channel key) |
| 2026-07-13 | M3 | Fixed CI portability for the reference-model job by removing the undeclared pytest runner dependency: tests now use Python stdlib `unittest`, CI invokes them with an explicit `PYTHONPATH`, and the local gate runs the same unittest suite before vector freshness. | A1 — `pallet-constitution` |
| 2026-07-13 | A1 | Started `pallet-constitution` as a workspace crate: added typed `ParamRecord`/`ParamValue` update validation with hard bounds, max-delta and cooldown checks; resettable meters; bounded capability records; `PhaseFlags` bit assignments; fixed-width 168-byte `ReleaseChannel` parsing; genesis parameter seeds for initial 13 §1 rows; and kernel/contract re-exports. Workspace Rust gates, no-default-features constitution tests, and docs link lint passed. A1 remains in progress because the crate is not yet a full FRAME pallet with storage/extrinsics, mock-runtime origin-misuse/error-path suites, try-state, and benchmark stubs. | Finish FRAME pallet wiring for `pallet-constitution`, add the A1 verification scaffolds, re-run gates, then mark A1 ✅ after spec-compliance review |

| 2026-07-13 | A1 | Completed `pallet-constitution`: added bounded meter storage and genesis state helpers, origin-gated dispatch entrypoints for parameter, capability, phase-flag, release-channel, and meter updates, a try-state validator for storage shape/ranges, runtime-benchmark stubs behind `runtime-benchmarks`, and expanded unit coverage for origin misuse plus error paths. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features constitution tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and a spec-compliance pass against 06, 13 §1/§4, 02 §7.3/§12, and 15 §4.1 found no blockers. A1 is now ✅. | A2 — `pallet-conditional-ledger` |

| 2026-07-13 | A2 | Implemented `pallet-conditional-ledger` as a workspace crate: proposal and Baseline vault records, per-branch supply accounting, split/merge/scalar/gate families, authority state transitions, `Voided`/`redeem_void`, terminal scalar/gate/Baseline redemptions with claimant-adverse floors, protocol-account deposit/cap exemptions, internal authority-origin API, try-state validation, runtime-benchmark stubs, and mock-style unit coverage for origin misuse/error paths. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features conditional-ledger tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and a spec-compliance pass against 03, 02 §6, and 15 §4.1–§4.3 found no blockers. A2 is now ✅. | A3 — `pallet-market` |

| 2026-07-13 | A3 | Implemented `pallet-market`: added the workspace member, no_std SCALE market storage/event types, LMSR buy/sell wrappers over `pallet-conditional-ledger`, branch/gate/Baseline book creation and POL seeding, 30 bps fee accounting, previous-quote capped observations/TWAP accumulation, `BaselineMarketOf`, try-state validation, benchmark stubs, and error-path tests for slippage/phase/trade limits plus Baseline duplicate mapping. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features market tests, and docs link lint passed; spec-compliance pass against 04 and 02 §5–§7.4 found no blockers. A3 is now ✅. | A4 — `pallet-origins` + `SafetyFilter` |

| 2026-07-14 | A4 | Implemented `pallet-origins`: added the workspace member, eight SCALE custom origins, proposal-class origin mapping, call-domain classification, `SafetyFilter` validation with the closed wrapper set (`batch`/`batch_all`/`force_batch`, `proxy`/`proxy_announced`, `as_multi`/`as_multi_threshold_1`, scheduler, sudo, and utility wrappers), bounded recursion/call-count checks, benchmark feature stub, and negative coverage for origin misuse and wrapper bypasses. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features origins tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and a spec-compliance pass against 06 §3, 01 §6, and 15 §1 found no blockers. A4 is now ✅. | A5 — `pallet-oracle` (reporter/watchtower registries, bonded reporting game, challenge rounds, reserve probe, neutral settlement) |
| 2026-07-14 | A5 | Implemented `pallet-oracle`: added the workspace member, SCALE-stable reporter/watchtower registries, value-scaled bonded report/challenge rounds, watchtower acknowledgment quorum with one-time extension and neutral settlement, recompute and OracleResolution adjudication paths, reporter offense/slash/ejection accounting, fail-static reserve probe state, try-state validation, runtime-benchmark stub, and origin/error-path tests. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features oracle tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and spec-compliance review against 07 §1–§6/§8–§13, 02 §7.2, 13 oracle/reserve rows, and 15 I-18/I-24 found no blockers. A5 is now ✅. | A6 — `pallet-registry` |
| 2026-07-14 | A6 | Implemented `pallet-registry`: added the workspace member, SCALE-stable Incident/Milestone filing state, bonded file/challenge/close paths, 72 h windows plus one 48 h quorum extension, watchtower acknowledgments, single-round challenge resolution, 40/60 slashing events, terminal epoch aggregates for Incident and Milestone instances, try-state validation, runtime-benchmark stub, and error-path tests for bounds, windows, spec-version mismatches, challenge discipline, quorum, and close-out. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features registry tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and spec-compliance review against 07 §7, 02 §6, 13 registry bounds, and 15 I-18/I-22 found no blockers. A6 is now ✅. | A7 — `pallet-welfare` |
| 2026-07-14 | A9 | Implemented `pallet-futarchy-treasury` out of dependency-order by explicit user request: added the workspace member, SCALE-stable treasury account/budget-line types, NAV and spendable-NAV view with reserve-health haircut flag, line-scoped outflow caps and 30/180-day rolling meters, mandatory linear streams with claim/cancel paths, VIT issuance restricted to REWARDS/ops lines under a rolling 2%/365-day cap, foreign-asset recovery, dedicated coretime renewal call, NAV floor checks/events, try-state validation, benchmark stub, and origin/error-path tests. Full Rust workspace gates, no-default-features treasury tests, runtime-benchmarks feature tests, docs link lint, and spec-compliance review against 08 §1/§6–§9, 13 treasury/issuance/ops rows, and 15 I-7/I-17/I-22 found no blockers. A9 is now ✅; dependency-order work should return to A7. | A7 — `pallet-welfare` |
