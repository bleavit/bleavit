## Purpose

Restore permissionless protocol progress when epoch work, decision-window observations, or
other keeper cranks fall behind, and preserve decision-grade coverage through metered-budget
exhaustion. A keeper outage makes the protocol safe but stagnant: it must never be worked around
by fabricating observations or forcing a decision.

## Alerts

| Domain | Key series | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Epoch progress | phase, blocks-to-boundary, tick lag | tick lag > 600 blocks |
| TWAP | coverage %, stale events, spot-vs-TWAP dispersion | coverage < 96% mid-window |
| Keepers | rebate claims per role, inactivity | no crank 1 h |
| Keeper budget | metered-budget utilization | > 80% of `keeper.budget` |
| Relay finality | relay best height, relay finalized height, finality stagnation seconds | finalized stagnant > 1800 s [VERIFY] while best is ahead |

Tick lag means finalized chain time has passed work which `epoch.tick` should have advanced.
Low mid-window coverage is decision-critical because gaps can make a book fail grade. Inactivity
means no successful sanctioned crank is visible for the affected role, not merely that one daemon
lost a race. Budget utilization warns that the on-chain rebate meter is nearing its payment latch;
it does not disable any crank.

Relay finality is the one row here that does **not** describe keeper behaviour. It fires when the
relay chain keeps producing blocks that GRANDPA is not finalizing, and it exists because the relay
finalized head is not parachain-runtime-observable: during such a stall the parachain finalized head
stops advancing too, so every other series in this runbook — tick lag included — freezes at its last
value instead of alerting. A relay finality alert therefore **invalidates the silence** of the other
four rows rather than adding to it; treat their quiet as uninformative until finality recovers. Its
`1800 s` window is `[VERIFY]` and must be recalibrated by Ops from observed healthy relay behaviour
([12 §6.3](../../docs/architecture/12-release-and-operations.md)).

## Diagnosis

1. Establish an independent finalized head from a second provider. Compare it with
   `bleavit_keeper_current_block` and `bleavit_keeper_connected`; a flat chain head is a chain or
   collator incident, while an advancing head with a flat keeper gauge is a fleet/RPC incident.
2. Read `FutarchyApi::epoch_status()` and direct `Epoch.EpochOf`/`Epoch.Schedule` storage at the
   same finalized hash. Record the phase, next boundary, dead-man state, and the last successful
   `tick` role timestamp before submitting anything ([05 §3](../../docs/architecture/05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)).
3. Compare every deployed instance and role using the shipped series
   `bleavit_keeper_planned_total`, `bleavit_keeper_submitted_total`,
   `bleavit_keeper_succeeded_total`, `bleavit_keeper_failed_total`, and
   `bleavit_keeper_last_successful_crank_timestamp_seconds`. Metric labels are the shipped roles
   `tick`, `observe`, `decide`, `settle`, `execute`, `oracle-close`, `registry-close`, `cleanup`,
   `renewal`, and `welfare` ([keeper metrics](../../keeper/bleavit-keeper/src/metrics.rs)).
4. For tick lag, inspect capability startup logs and live metadata for `Epoch.tick`. If plans rise
   but submissions do not, inspect signer funding, nonce/finality timeouts, and RPC failover. If
   submissions rise but successes do not, decode the finalized dispatch error; ordinary
   race-losses are benign only when another keeper advanced the same state.
5. For TWAP loss, identify every decision-window book from live proposals and inspect
   `Market.Markets`, `Market.DecisionWindows`, `Market.WindowCheckpoints`, `Observed` events, and
   `bleavit_keeper_stale_decision_window_books{role="observe"}`. Prioritize stale decision-window
   observations ahead of general observations; the shipped planner does this explicitly
   ([04 §7](../../docs/architecture/04-markets-and-pricing.md)).
6. For the inactivity page, evaluate timestamps per required role. A cleanup success must not
   mask an idle `observe`, `tick`, or `decide` role. Exclude intentionally disabled roles, and
   confirm whether no work was due before declaring a daemon unhealthy
   ([keeper operator guide](../../keeper/README.md)).
7. For the budget page, read `FutarchyTreasury.State.keeper_meter` and the live `keeper.budget` Param,
   then correlate `KeeperBudgetLow { remaining }` and
   `KeeperBudgetExhausted { epoch, spent }`. Both events are latch-once per epoch; effective
   exhaustion emits Low before Exhausted, and Exhausted latches all further metered payments for
   that epoch even if a later parameter change would create headroom
   ([treasury core](../../crates/futarchy-treasury-core/src/lib.rs)).
8. Confirm the failure is not only rebate custody: payout or line-funding failure returns zero
   without charging the meter and cannot roll back the useful crank. Distinguish that from an
   exhausted meter by the on-chain events and meter flags.
9. For relay finality, read `bleavit_relay_best_block`, `bleavit_relay_finalized_block`, and
   `bleavit_relay_finality_stagnation_seconds` from the relay finality monitor
   ([`relay_finality_monitor.py`](../../tools/monitoring/relay_finality_monitor.py)). Classify first:
   best advancing with finalized flat is a **relay GRANDPA stall**; both flat is a **relay halt**;
   the three series **absent** with `bleavit_relay_monitor_connected` at 0 and
   `bleavit_relay_monitor_errors_total` rising is a **monitor or relay-RPC failure**, not evidence
   about the relay — the row fails closed, so absence never means healthy. Confirm any of the three
   against a second, independently operated relay endpoint before escalating; the monitor's endpoint
   is deliberately separate from the parachain exporter's, and a single-endpoint reading cannot
   distinguish a stalled relay from an unreachable one.
10. Once a relay stall is confirmed, treat every parachain-derived series in this runbook as stale
    rather than healthy, and check the relay-side validator/GRANDPA telemetry and the relay's own
    release/incident channels. Nothing on this chain can advance relay finality, and the collator
    fleet is not the fault domain.

## Remediation

### Safe / permissionless

1. Restore at least two independent live keeper instances on distinct RPC providers and failure
   domains. Live mode requires an explicit funded signer; `--dry-run` diagnoses but cannot restore
   progress ([01 §4.2](../../docs/architecture/01-system-overview.md)).
2. Enable the missing live-metadata capability and let the planner submit its bounded,
   idempotent calls. During a decision window, restore `observe`, `tick`, `decide`, `settle`, and
   required `welfare` work before general observation or reaping. Do not hand-construct guessed
   arguments when the planner has disabled a capability.
3. Keep cranking after `KeeperBudgetExhausted`. Every sanctioned crank remains Signed,
   permissionless, and idempotent; only the rebate stops. This is the status-quo-safe continuity
   rule in [08 §6.3](../../docs/architecture/08-treasury-and-economics.md).
4. If the chain itself is stalled or dead-man is engaged, do not replay stale work against an
   unfinalized head. Restore finality first; the epoch clock and decision windows apply their
   specified pause/recovery behavior.
5. Under a confirmed relay finality stall there is no permissionless remediation on this chain:
   keep the keeper fleet running and idle rather than resubmitting against the unfinalized head, and
   do not attempt to compensate for the stall by widening timeouts or forcing cranks. Every crank is
   idempotent, so the backlog drains on its own once finality resumes. If the relay-parent gap grows
   past its trigger the dead-man engages by design — that is the specified protective behavior, not
   an incident to work around ([05 §4.6](../../docs/architecture/05-welfare-and-decision-engine.md)).
   Restore the monitor itself promptly if the alert was a collection failure: while the relay series
   are absent this chain has no independent finality observer at all.

### Privileged

1. The Keeper coordinator may use the funded `ops.keepers` commitment to keep operator accounts
   and infrastructure running beyond meter exhaustion. Any on-chain line funding or spend must
   arrive through a passed TREASURY action and the `FutarchyTreasury` origin; there is no admin
   top-up path ([06 §3.2](../../docs/architecture/06-governance-and-guardians.md),
   [08 §1.1](../../docs/architecture/08-treasury-and-economics.md)).
2. Funding `ops.keepers` does not reopen an exhausted per-epoch keeper meter. Treat it as the
   specified operator-subsidy continuity path, not as permission to alter meter state or retry a
   claimant-favoring payout.
3. Do not use a guardian action merely to cure keeper inactivity or low coverage. Guardian
   playbooks require their own verified trigger; missing information must extend or reject to the
   status quo under the decision rules.

## Escalation

Page the Keeper coordinator first. Page the Infrastructure coordinator when finalized-head or
RPC/archive evidence points outside the fleet, the Oracle operations coordinator for stalled
oracle/registry roles, and the Monitoring coordinator when alert/event ingestion disagrees with
direct finalized storage ([12 §6.1](../../docs/architecture/12-release-and-operations.md)). The
**Relay finality** row escalates to the **Infrastructure coordinator** specifically, and does so
immediately rather than after keeper triage: the fault domain is the relay chain and the RPC/archive
estate that observes it, never the keeper fleet, so the Keeper coordinator holds this row only long
enough to confirm the classification in Diagnosis step 9. When that step attributes the alert to the
monitor or its relay endpoint rather than to the relay, it is the **Monitoring coordinator** who
owns restoring the observer, with the Infrastructure coordinator supplying a second independent
relay endpoint. If a
verified dead-man, reserve, migration, or ledger-drift trigger is present, hand off to its named
guardian playbook runbook; keeper budget exhaustion alone activates none. Record decision-window
coverage loss, affected proposals/books, unpaid continuity duration, and funding used in the
postmortem.
