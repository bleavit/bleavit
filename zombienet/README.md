# Bleavit Zombienet environments

These committed topology, patch, drill, and helper definitions implement the
release-artifact obligation in [15 §4.7](../docs/architecture/15-invariants-and-testing.md)
and the Zombienet artifact row in [02 §11](../docs/architecture/02-integration-contract.md).
They are the definitions consumed by release and frontend e2e jobs, not private
fixtures.

> **15 §4.7:** “Zombienet relay + parachain topologies exercising epoch
> progression under collator loss, keeper loss, and relay finality stalls
> (dead-man test), plus the XCM reserve-transfer suites including failure,
> trap, and recovery.”

> **02 §11:** “Relay+para topology files + genesis overrides matching the
> release.”

## Reproduce

Run from the repository root:

```bash
tools/env/fetch-binaries.sh
tools/env/generate-relay-specs.sh
cargo build --release -p bleavit-node --locked
(cd keeper && cargo build --release --locked -p bleavit-keeper)
zombienet/bin/zombienet -p native spawn zombienet/networks/bleavit-local.toml
zombienet/bin/zombienet -p native test zombienet/drills/01-smoke.zndsl
```

The fetch script sources [`tools/env/pins.env`](../tools/env/pins.env), downloads
the linux-x86_64 relay worker quartet and Zombienet, and verifies every SDK
download against its release-published `.sha256` sidecar before installation;
the Zombienet release publishes no sidecars, so its binary is verified against
the `ZOMBIENET_SHA256` digest pinned in `pins.env`. Other hosts fail with a
pointer to build the pinned sources. The generator checks out the
Paseo chain-spec-generator tag in `target/env/`, verifies its immutable commit
pin, builds it with `--locked`, proves all three required local chain names are
accepted, and emits valid JSON specs. It then
reuses [`tools/deploy/generate-chain-specs.sh`](../tools/deploy/generate-chain-specs.sh)
for the Bleavit plain spec and converts that same spec to raw form for
Chopsticks.

[`genesis/drill-overrides.json`](genesis/drill-overrides.json) is a
chain-spec-builder patch, with its owning citations here because JSON has no
comment syntax. It repeats the release bootstrap `PhaseFlags = shadow |
sudo-present` and supplies seven deterministic dev guardians so the real 5-of-7
workflow is exercisable. It does **not** replace `Params`: the pallet seeds the
13 §1 registry from code, preventing a chain-spec parameter bypass.

No protocol timing is compressed in the **release** drill spec (`bleavit-drill.json`):
the seeded `epoch.length` is 302,400 blocks, the expedited CODE descriptor lead is
43,200 blocks, playbook expiry remains 201,600 blocks, `dec.window` remains 43,200
blocks, and `mkt.obs_interval` remains 10 blocks. The default-off **`fast-timing`**
test spec (`bleavit-drill-fast.json`, SQ-128) — booted by drills `04`, `08`, and `09`
— compresses only the epoch clock plus drill-04's `DEAD_MAN_RELAY_BLOCKS` (4,800→48)
and drill-08's descriptor lead (43,200→12), all off one `kernel::FAST_DAY_BLOCKS`
knob; the release runtime stays byte-frozen (guard test
`production_epoch_timing_floors_are_frozen`). Dead-man helpers poll relay best and
finalized heads until the real stalled-finality gap (4,800 blocks release / 48 fast)
exists; they never substitute wall-clock sleep for a block threshold.

## Run evidence

[`tools/env/run-evidence.py`](../tools/env/run-evidence.py) executes the suites
listed in [`tools/env/suites.json`](../tools/env/suites.json) against the built
release node, generated chain specs, and the exact release Wasm. After fetching
the pinned binaries, generating the specs, and building the node, a release-tier
Zombienet run is:

```bash
python3 tools/env/run-evidence.py \
  --kind zombienet \
  --tier release \
  --wasm release-work/runtime/runtime.wasm \
  --try-runtime-wasm target/release/wbuild/bleavit-runtime/bleavit_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The G1-tier drills — `05` (a real-time ~8 h dead-man run) plus `04`, `08`, and `09`
(now default-off `fast-timing` compressed-runtime proofs, SQ-128, replacing the
~16 h / ~3 day / ~63 day release-cadence soaks) — are recorded as tier
exclusions in a release run. Evidence can be
emitted only by `--tier release`; `--tier g1`, `--tier all`, cherry-picked
`--suites`, and any custom `--zombienet-binary`, `--chopsticks-command`, or
`--node-binary` are report-only. Every release-tier drill of the emitted kind
must be attempted and pass, so a `gated_on` skip blocks evidence and
`--include-gated` is required while a release-tier gate remains. In evidence
mode, the default Zombienet binary is mandatory and its SHA-256 must match
`ZOMBIENET_SHA256` from `tools/env/pins.env`. A successful evidence-producing
run deletes downloaded binaries, generated specs, and prior evidence, then
hashes only the clean committed definitions (preserving the
generated-directory `.gitignore` files). The resulting `run-evidence.json`
follows the consumer contract in
[`tools/release/README.md`](../tools/release/README.md); release assembly remains
the final gate.

## Runnability

| Drill | Spec | Runnable-now assertions | Gated assertions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-smoke` | 15 §4.7; 02 §11 | Four relay validators and three collators start; para 4242 registers and produces included blocks | none |
| `02-collator-loss` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-18 (G1)**: pre-fault/post-fault/recovery height deltas over real native SIGSTOP/SIGCONT (V-24 confirmed) | none |
| `03-keeper-loss` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-18 (G1)**: the real live-mode B9 daemon runs as Zombienet's `keeper` node (exec wrapper → keeper PID receives SIGSTOP/SIGCONT) and survives the pause/resume window; drill-asserted: pause/resume, `is up`, post-resume `bleavit_keeper_connected ≥ 1`, and parachain-height deltas proving collator liveness. Log-verified (not drill-asserted): role detection from live metadata | none |
| `04-dead-man` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1; 13 §2 | Native pause/resume, relay-block RPC stall measurement (48 fast-timing / 4,800 release), and the freeze-assertion surfaces (`epoch.deadMan`, `executionGuard.deadManFreeze`, phase-flag bit 6) — the A8/A11 wiring landed, so the helper's metadata gates pass | **First execution 2026-07-20** (fast-timing, SQ-128 extended: `DEAD_MAN_RELAY_BLOCKS` 4,800→48): the stall compressed ~16 h→~8 min (reached gap 48 in ~8 min — **timing proven**), but `assert-dead-man engaged` **failed (16/17)** — the parachain kept producing (liveness `pre-fault,2` passed), so `observe_dead_man` saw no relay-**parent** jump. Root cause **SQ-282**: the B10 detector fires on a relay-parent jump (outage/catch-up), not a relay-**finality** stall (open 05 §4.8 `F`-signal `[VERIFY]`). Re-gated on SQ-282; timing is no longer the blocker |
| `05-coretime-renewal-under-dead-man` | 09 §4/§7.1 | XCM topology, relay-block stall measurement, liveness deltas, and (2026-07-20) the drill-side **staged-renewal exit-form** code: `stage`/`execute`/`probe` branches that note a live authenticated quote as the genesis authority (Alice) and assert `ExtrinsicSuccess` + `CoretimeRenewalCalled` + quote consumption; the retained `probe` branch proves the **exemption-reachability form** (the dispatch traverses the staged freeze into treasury logic and fails exactly `RenewalWindowClosed`; a filter/freeze rejection fails the drill) | **genesis seeding + long-horizon run** (PLAN SQ-245/SQ-246 ruled; B12 surface landed): the funded `ops.coretime` budget line and treasury DOT/USDC custody are not chain-spec-fundable — `fund_budget_line`/`set_coretime_authority` need the unreachable `FutarchyTreasury` origin (sudo→Root rejected, `sudo_as` denied) — so they must be genesis-seeded (raw `futarchyTreasury.State` line + `foreignAssets.accounts`); the exit form then runs under a real 4,800-relay-block dead-man stall (~8 h, g1-tier). Dead-man **engagement** landed with B10 (see drill 04) |
| `06-pb-migration` | 09 §3.2/§7.1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-20 (G1, 3/3)** on a dedicated plain migration topology: blocks to height ≥ 10; `assert-halt` verifies the genesis-staged `MigrationHalt = true` (the SQ-274 trigger, seeded via the new `pallet-execution-guard` `migration_halt` genesis field, with a storage-key self-check); `rollback` runs the guardian 5-of-7 recovery (`propose_action` + four `approve_action`s, membership decoded from `[Option<AccountId>; 7]`) and the dispatching approval **correctly fails closed** — the Migration playbook has no EmergencyPlaybook-safe runtime call (R-7: retrying a stuck cursor needs Root-only controls; the runtime `playbook_calls(Migration)` returns `Other(…)`), so the trigger being ACTIVE yields `DispatchError::Other`, distinct from the pre-SQ-274 `TriggerInactive` (trigger never engaged) and from a successful activation (none exists) | none — SQ-274 resolved (see PLAN + Decision log): the drill stages the guard trigger at genesis via the `migration_halt` genesis field (a PLAIN spec the pinned zombienet can schedule; a raw storage-injected spec is not), with no production fault-injection surface (R-7) |
| `07-xcm-reserve-transfer` | 15 §4.7; 09 §6.1 | v5 inputs and decoded source/destination event correlation are complete; readiness is a genuine **capability probe** on the genesis-registered canonical Location-keyed USDC (SQ-101), not a version sentinel; the recovery `ClaimAsset` send is dispatched through the local preset's **sudo** so it carries Asset Hub's bare chain origin (a signed send would descend to the signer's account origin and could never match the AH-chain-keyed trap) | **Asset Hub block production** (first real run, 2026-07-20): the stale `spec_version === 1` sentinel is **retired** (WP-1) — the B10 XCM composition (`AssetTransactor`, `Barrier`, `IsReserve`, `IsTeleporter`, `OriginConverter`, sender) is present exactly when the canonical USDC is registered, which the helper now probes, and the Bleavit side boots — but the first end-to-end execution found the pinned Paseo `asset-hub-paseo-runtime` **trapping on its parachain-system inherent** (`AbortedDueToTrap` in `cumulus_pallet_parachain_system`), so Asset Hub (para 1000) never produces blocks and the drill cannot reach its XCM legs. This is a Paseo chain-spec-generator/system-runtime integration issue (not Bleavit); owned by the env pins |
| `08-expedited-code-under-freeze` | 09 §2.1/§3.2/§7.1 | B6 wires ExecutionGuard at slot 62; the receipt-aware authorize → early-reject → lead-time wait → apply definition targets that real surface, reading the **live** `descriptorLeadTime` metadata constant (12 fast-timing / 43,200 release) rather than a hardcode | **Fast-timing (SQ-128 extended, 2026-07-20)** compresses the D-14 lead 43,200→12, removing the ~3-day wait; G1 setup must still stage the attested queued expedited proposal and active ledger freeze at genesis (**SQ-233**) before the lane runs — timing is no longer the blocker |
| `09-three-unattended-epochs` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1; 13 §1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-20 (G1, 6/6)** against a default-off `fast-timing` compressed-epoch test runtime: three real 84-block epochs (`epoch.length = 21 × FAST_DAY(4)`; SQ-128 implemented) advanced unattended in ~29 min — para height 84→168→252 at ~7.4 s/block with the topology `keeper` node cranking `Epoch.tick` and finalizing each tick; `assert-epoch-progression.js` reads the LIVE `epoch.schedule().length` (cadence-agnostic, asserts identically vs the release runtime) and requires `epoch.epochOf().index ≥ 3`. Boots `zombienet/networks/bleavit-fast.toml` (para spec `bleavit-drill-fast.json`, wasm built into a separate `target/fast-timing` dir); not a CI test | none — SQ-128 implemented (see PLAN + Decision log): compresses only the epoch clock (two kernel floors + three registry seeds off one `kernel::FAST_DAY_BLOCKS` knob), release runtime byte-frozen (guard test `production_epoch_timing_floors_are_frozen`); the release-cadence "3 unattended epochs" is subsumed by G2's ≥6-epoch Paseo run |

NOTE(G1): drill-authoring constraints established by the first real `zndsl`
executions (2026-07-17). The pinned Zombienet grammar (version:
`tools/env/pins.env`) accepts **no `#` comment lines** (drill rationale therefore lives in this README, spec
citations in the `Description:` line) and **requires a `Creds: config` line**
after `Network:`. All Zombienet timeouts — the toml `[settings] timeout` and
every DSL `within N seconds` — are converted to 32-bit signed milliseconds, so
values above 2,147,483 s silently overflow (the original 6,000,000 s network
timeout collapsed to a 1 ms watchdog); long waits must be split into
sequential ≤ 2,000,000 s steps as drill 09 does.

NOTE(B7, confirmed G1): the pinned `NativeClient` implements `pause`/`resume`
with `SIGSTOP`/`SIGCONT`. Upstream DSL documentation still describes those
commands as Podman/Kubernetes-only; the first end-to-end native executions
(drills 02/03, 2026-07-18) confirmed they work against real node and keeper
PIDs (V-24).

NOTE(B7, updated G1 + post-B10/B12 merges): `Epoch` (61) and `ExecutionGuard`
(62) are instantiated in the runtime, B10 landed the dead-man detector and
the production XCM composition, and B12 landed the coretime renewal surface
(authority quote-noting, `RenewalDispatch`). **G1 (2026-07-20): drills 01/02/03
and 06 pass against the merged runtime** — SQ-274 resolved, so drill 06 stages
the PB-MIGRATION trigger at genesis (the `migration_halt` guard genesis field)
and exercises the guardian recovery to its correct fail-closed refusal. The
remaining drill-blocking items are **drill 04's dead-man detector/scenario
mismatch** (SQ-282 — its timing is proven, ~16 h→~8 min), **drill 08's
freeze/expedited genesis staging** (SQ-233 — its ~3-day D-14 lead is now
compressed to 12 blocks), drill 05's genesis seeding + ~8 h dead-man run
(long-horizon), and drill 07's **Asset Hub topology** (its `spec_version`
sentinel was retired, but the pinned Paseo `asset-hub-paseo-runtime` traps on
its parachain-system inherent). Helpers intentionally fail with precise
messages when required state or metadata surfaces are absent;
supported boot/liveness assertions remain live.

## Mandatory closing try-state

The evidence runner executes the mandatory closing try-state (15 §1; SQ-204).
`zombienet test` tears its network down on completion, so the runner drives the
pinned Zombienet in two phases: `spawn --monitor` (the pinned CLI's "do not auto
cleanup network" flag, available on `spawn` only) publishes `zombie.json` into a
run directory and holds the topology up, then `test <drill.zndsl> <zombie.json>`
runs the drill against that already-running network. The node therefore survives
the drill, the closing check runs against it, and only then is the process group
torn down. The endpoint is resolved from the drill's own topology: a collator
`rpc_port` must be pinned there, because a randomly allocated port cannot be
addressed and guessing one would attest try-state against the wrong node —
`bleavit-xcm.toml` pins none today, so drill 07 fails closed until it does.

The checker is the `try-runtime-cli` pinned as `TRY_RUNTIME_VERSION` /
`TRY_RUNTIME_SHA256` in [`tools/env/pins.env`](../tools/env/pins.env) and
installed by `tools/env/fetch-binaries.sh`; in evidence mode its SHA-256 must
match that pin, and `--try-runtime-binary` forces report-only. The equivalent
manual command, against a network you spawned yourself:

```bash
try-runtime \
  --runtime target/release/wbuild/bleavit-runtime/bleavit_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
  on-runtime-upgrade --checks try-state --blocktime 6000 \
  live --uri ws://127.0.0.1:9944
```

Build that Wasm with the runtime's `try-runtime` feature before executing the
command; it is what `--try-runtime-wasm` names. The same closing command applies
to every drill, including smoke.
